America’s Misguided Immigration Debate
A debate on immigration is beginning in the United States Senate, which will take up several proposals.
These include a hateful bill – which the House of Representatives has already approved – that provides for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexican border and makes unauthorized entry into the US a felony.
The US Senate will also consider a bill co-authored by Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator John McCain, which proposes stronger border enforcement, a temporary workers program with a path to residency and citizenship, and legalization for people already in the US without papers.
This last component is largely rhetoric; it is hard to imagine any Mexican already in the US voluntarily returning to, say, Zacatecas to wait patiently in line for a new visa.
President George W. Bush has been skirting the question ever since he committed himself to an immigration agreement with Mexico when he visited President Vicente Fox in Guanajuato almost exactly five years ago.
The latter status may or may not include a path to residency and citizenship; fudging the issue may be a negotiating tactic to avoid debate over whether this is a form of disguised amnesty (which, fortunately, to a certain extent, it is).
That changed in the 1980’s, when Central America’s civil wars sent hundreds of thousands of migrants thru Mexico to the US, and then in the 1990’s, when people fleeing violence in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador also began searching for opportunity.
Moreover, these migrants are no longer exclusively of rural origin, nor do they travel only to traditional areas in the US; they are, literally, everywhere.
Their remittances contribute immensely to the economic welfare of their families, communities, and home countries’ economies.
This will occur precisely at a time when Latin America is swerving left, with country after country drifting back to anti-American, populist stances: Venezuela in 1999, Bolivia last year, perhaps Mexico, Peru, and Nicaragua later this year.
The best way to accentuate the region’s growing anti-American sentiment is to try to close the US-Mexican border (which will be futile).
Instead, the US should establish humane, secure, and legal mechanisms of temporary or permanent entry for people the American economy needs and wants, and it should work with, not against, governments in Latin America.
Five years ago, Mexico’s President Vicente Fox tried to convince Bush that something had to be done before a nativist backlash in the US complicated its relations with Latin America and made goals such as a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) impossible.
But matters have gotten worse: border tensions between the US and Mexico have grown, the proposed wall has rightly provoked indignation, more unauthorized immigrants than ever are entering the US, and the FTAA has collapsed.
Bush must begin to use what political capital he has left to support enlightened immigration reform, along the lines of the Kennedy-McCain bill.
He will never get a guest-worker program without Democratic support, which in turn is unlikely unless the White House supports access to a program for unauthorized immigrants already in the US that includes some type of path to residence and citizenship.
Mexico and the US must be sensitive to domestic political concerns in both countries.
No immigration deal is feasible north of the border without addressing security matters; south of the border, there is no conceivable Mexican cooperation on border security or on a Temporary Workers Program if immigration reform ignores the nearly five million Mexican citizens without papers currently living in the US.
Mexico has to assume responsibility for regulating this traffic, which means more than sealing off its southern border.
The government could, for example, double welfare payments to households whose male heads stay home, threaten to revoke land reform rights after years of absence in rural communities, and establish choke points on highways at the Tehuantepec Isthmus.
Fox has said that he is willing to break with old Mexican taboos, but the Bush administration has never taken him up on it.
That is unfortunate, because Fox will not be around forever.
Immigration has always been an immensely complex and delicate issue inside the US, and now for Latin America as well.
A window of opportunity opened at the beginning of Bush’s first term, and closed shut after the terrorist attacks of September 2001.
A New Anti-Semitism
Some believe that we are experiencing a new kind of conflict: “culture wars,” such as those between Sunni and Shiite Muslims or tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or indeed Islamists and Westerners.
However, the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be more traditional.
Ruthless leaders mobilize disoriented followers.
Its comeback takes the classical form of attacks on individuals, like the recent killing of a young Jew in France, or of disfiguring symbolic places, like cemeteries and synagogues.
One would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust; but it did not.
There are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place, or that it did in its all-too-well-documented manner.
The deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran’s recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The evidence of what Nazi Germany did is so powerful that those who deny it can probably be dealt with even without putting them in prison and thereby drawing more attention to them than they deserve.
To be sure, America is the first name in anti-Western resentment.
But its second name is Israel, the only successful modern country in the Middle East, which is also highly militarized, an occupying power, and ruthless in defense of its interests.
Palestine romanticism glorifies the Palestinians as the victims of Israel’s rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as at best second-class citizens, and cites the many incidents of oppression in the occupied territories, including the effects of Israel’s “security fence.”
Implicitly or explicitly, people take the side of the victims, contribute by sending money to them, declare even suicide bombers legitimate, and move ever further away from support for and defense of Israel.
This makes their friends hesitate to speak up for fear of being painted into not just an anti-Israel, but also an anti-Semitic corner.
The defensiveness of Jews and the uneasy silence of their friends mean that the stage of public debate is open for those who actually are anti-Semitic, though they confine themselves to anti-Israel language.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises.
This is true also for other kinds of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique, because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people.
It is linked to Israel.
If one belongs to a generation that regarded Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, and admired the way in which the country provided a proud home for the persecuted and downtrodden, one is particularly concerned that it may now be at risk.
China’s Baby Step
Whatever the ultimate economic effects of China’s first modest step towards floating its currency, one has to admire its strategic brilliance.
The genius of China’s mini-move (allowing the Yuan to rise 2% against the dollar) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next.
Protectionists in the United States and Europe, itching to slap huge punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, have been caught flat-footed.
They want to keep bathing in press coverage, but if they push their China-bashing too far and too fast, the protectionists will be seen as hindering delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations.
By relenting just a little to intense global pressure to revalue its exchange rate, the Chinese leadership has masterfully stifled the growing chorus of demands to rein in its growing trade surplus.
While hardly denting global trade imbalances, a small move would bring in a flood of foreign capital, overwhelming China’s currency defenses and leading to chaos. So far, that has not happened and, China once again seems to have gone its own way and proved the experts wrong.
It can hold the fort because it maintains one of the world’s strictest regimes of exchange and capital controls.
Unlike many Latin American and former Soviet-bloc countries, where similar controls are honored mainly in the breach, violating capital controls in China is virtually a capital offense.
But, over the past fifty years, when many other countries, including France and Italy, implemented draconian controls, the result was always the same: eventually, the private sector adapted and eroded the controls’ effectiveness.
Whether by misreporting imports and exports or exploiting corrupt government officials (which China has in ample supply), private capital eventually starts finding its way around the controls if the incentives are strong enough.
Thus, even if the Chinese authorities can somehow keep their capital controls from hemorrhaging as the country’s financial system becomes more sophisticated and decentralized, they will not be able to stop the controls from dying a death of a thousand cuts.
After that, China will be able to keep its exchange rate pegged only by slavishly following US interest-rate policy, which makes no sense for such a large and diverse region.
It is a lot easier to exit from a fixed exchange rate regime when the pressures on the currency are upwards.
While it may seem hard to imagine that the speculative tide might ever turn against China, exchange-rate pressures can turn in an instant.
Considering China’s huge and growing income inequalities, and its massive disguised rural unemployment, it is easy to imagine a period of political instability that sends investors heading for the exits.
Mix in China’s shaky financial system and the prospect of trade sanctions after an altercation over, say, Taiwan, and it is clear that the Yuan might not always be a one-way bet.
So should we expect to see much bigger currency moves in China anytime soon?
Should we ever expect to see wild gyrations in China’s exchange rate of the sort one routinely sees in, say, the Australian dollar or the South African rand?
Neither scenario is very likely.
Only fire-breathing free-market advocates, seemingly oblivious to the fact that China’s shaky financial system cannot survive liberalization overnight, are calling for an extreme version of floating.
The first round of Yuan revaluation won’t be over until the currency is up against the dollar by at least 10%, and probably more.
China’s first currency move was brilliant only if it is not the last.
China’s Exchange-Rate Puzzle
China’s abrupt decision to raise the value of the renminbi (yuan) by 2.1% and to end its peg to the dollar comes after months of pressure from the US.
But the revaluation is likely to be a one-time affair and the free floating of the renminbi is probably not real because a stable currency is very much in China’s interest.
Indeed, the economist Robert Mundell, whose work on optimal monetary zones is credited with laying the theoretical groundwork for the euro, insists that China should maintain its fixed exchange rate as a necessary part of its current phase of economic development.
But, owing to China’s skewed economic structure, its exchange-rate regime presents much more challenging problems than those encountered by Japan and other East Asian economies.
But the effectiveness of a fixed exchange rate is determined by how developments in the export sector influence domestic industries and the national economy as a whole.
If growth in the trade sector boosts that of domestic non-trade sectors, then a fixed exchange rate will not put pressure on the external balance of payments as demand for imports rises.
Under these circumstances, revaluation of the exchange rate will not have a severe impact on an economy’s development.
For example, Japanese economists argue that the Plaza Agreement, which called for “orderly appreciation” of non-dollar currencies against the dollar, was a natural outgrowth of high national income.
Pressure for revaluation comes at a stage when per capita national income is merely $1,000, not $10,000 or $15,000, so China still needs a rather long period of rapid economic growth to reach anything like the stage that Japan had achieved when it allowed the yen to be revalued.
Most of China 460,000 foreign-owned enterprises are concentrated in manufacturing and assembling, increasing the import-intensiveness of exports and de-linking the external-trade sector from domestic industries.
This helps to widen regional disparities, especially between eastern and western China, with the wealthiest regions being those that have benefited from high concentrations of FDI.
No one should realistically expect the renminbi’s exchange rate to be determined solely by the income level of the relatively prosperous eastern coastal regions.
But the surplus merely masks the structural problems of China’s domestic economic sectors and poorer regions.
Although the expansion of exports has been dramatic, now accounting for 70% of China’s GDP, it has exerted no pull on other economic sectors, because it has been confined to foreign-owned manufacturing and assembling enterprises.
Pressure for revaluation stems, therefore, not from the real needs of China economy, but from large imbalances in the United States, particularly its long-standing trade deficit, which exceeds 5% of GDP.
However, dollar supremacy means that the US can sustain a much wider balance-of-payments deficit than other countries.
As long as Asia holds its foreign reserves in dollars China’s desire to maintain a stable value for the reminbi will continue to offer tremendous advantages for trade and economic development.
Democracy Comes Second
From the Middle East to Latin America and Asia, many autocracies are taking gradual steps towards more democratic and accountable forms of government, or have become fully-fledged and well functioning democracies.
There are many reasons to celebrate the current democratic wave.
Democracy is associated with less injustice and abuse, with basic civic and political freedoms, and with greater sensitivity by governments for the true priorities of its citizens.
After all, is it not true that virtually all rich countries have democratic forms of government, while the poorest countries (mainly in Africa) are non-democracies?
Indeed, throughout the world, democracy is strongly correlated with higher per capita income.
But this correlation goes missing when one looks at the dimension of time rather than space.
Countries that become democracies do not, on average, achieve faster economic growth after their political transition; and, vice versa, democracies that fail and relapse into autocracy do not, on average, do worse than before.
The positive correlation between income and democracy that one sees across countries could be due to reverse causation: democracy is more likely to persist as a country grows richer.
It could also be due to special historical or cultural circumstances: some societies are just more successful than others, both in terms of economic development and with regard to their ability to develop and maintain democratic political institutions.
Whatever the reason for the observed positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy, it should not be confused with causality.
Being democratic does not seem important in securing economic success.
Of course, there are many different kinds of democratic transitions, and lumping them all together might be misleading.
An important distinction in practice concerns the interaction between the economic and the political system.
A democracy born in an open economic environment, with a well functioning market system, widespread foreign direct investment, and sizeable international trade, is likely to consolidate economic liberalism, stabilize expectations, and hence lead to more investment and faster growth.
In the post-WWII period, the more successful episodes of democratic transitions have been preceded by widespread economic reforms that extended the scope of the market and facilitated international integration.
This applies to the episodes of democratization in Latin America and the Philippines in the mid-1980’s, but also to Turkey in the early 1980’s and Nepal in 1990.
China first opened its economic system to the rest of the world, and only now is it thinking (a bit too slowly) about political reform.
Russia instead jumped into democracy, and only then worried about replacing socialism with a market system.
But the sequence of reforms is critical for successful economic development, with economic reforms coming first.
When an open and well functioning market system is in place, democracy has a much better chance to lead to lasting prosperity.
These fundamental rights are part and parcel of democratic government.
But today’s young democracies have to do everything much faster.
They don’t have the luxury of restricting suffrage to property owners, or to more educated citizens.
We should insist that Egypt or Pakistan improve their market system, apply the rule of law, and open their economies to international trade and capital movements.
Devaluing Life
In August 2001, President George W. Bush told Americans that he worried about “a culture that devalues life,” and that he believed that, as President of the United States, he has “an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in America and throughout the world.”
That belief lay behind Bush’s denial of federal government funds for stem-cell research that could encourage the destruction of human embryos.
Although the Bush administration acknowledged that some scientists believe stem cell research could offer new ways of treating diseases that affect 128 million Americans, this prospect evidently did not, in Bush’s view, justify destroying human embryos.
Eighteen people were killed, among them five children.
Bush did not apologize for the attack, nor did he reprimand those who ordered it.
Apparently, he believes that the chance of killing an important terrorist leader is sufficient justification for firing a missile that will almost certainly kill innocent human beings.
Senator Trent Lott, a conservative Republican – and a prominent opponent of abortion – said of the attack: “Absolutely, we should do it.”
Senator John McCain, another leading Republican, though one often ready to disagree with Bush, expressed regret for the civilian deaths, but added, “I can’t tell you that we wouldn’t do the same thing again.”
On November 1, 2001, American planes bombed Ishaq Suleiman, a group of mud huts, because a Taliban truck had been parked in one of the streets.
One bomb hit the home of the Hamoodi family, a respected, educated family, none of whose members belonged to the ruling Baath Party.
Of the extended family of 14, ten were killed, including an infant, a two-year-old baby, a 10-year-old boy, and a 12-year-old girl.
After all, if they remain at large, they may succeed in carrying out further terrorist attacks that take hundreds or even thousands of innocent lives.
Bush, however, cannot rely on that argument, for it is precisely the kind of justification that he rejects when it comes to destroying embryos in order to save, in the long run, those dying from diseases for which we currently have no cure.
Other moralists will say that the difference between destroying embryos for research purposes and killing civilians in military attacks is that the former is deliberate killing, whereas the latter deaths are “collateral damage” – unintended, if foreseeable, side-effects of a justifiable act of war.
We can grant that it was not the primary intention of those who planned and authorized the attack on Damadola to kill innocent people.
We can also accept that al-Zawahiri is undoubtedly a dangerous foe, still active in a terrorist movement, and that he is a legitimate military target.
The presence of a Taliban truck does not justify bombing a village in which civilians are going about their daily lives.
Killing innocent people in order to bring a kind of rough justice to “Chemical Ali” – a particularly nasty member of Saddam’s military elite, but one who at the time of the raid was no longer in command of military forces – is wrong.
A culture that allows – and even endorses – such tactics is not one that is genuinely committed to encouraging respect for life.
We can be quite sure that American forces would not have acted in the same way if the civilians nearby had been other Americans.
Do Low Interest Rates Ensure High Asset Prices?
Although history is often a good predictor of future trends, every now and then something fundamental changes that makes for a new pattern.
But investors should be wary of this argument.
It may sound plausible, but it is hardly conclusive, and, more importantly, it certainly does not tell us that high prices are sustainable.
According to the IMF, world real long-term interest rates peaked at nearly 7% on average in 1984, and fell to just below 2% by 2004.
It is not that there is “too much” saving around the world today, but that the amount of saving has been high enough that returns, as measured by real interest rates, are a lot lower than they once were.
In a March 2005 speech, Bernanke argued that this “glut” helps explain several features of the American economy, possibly including the enormous fiscal and trade deficits.
Low real long-term rates mean that any long-term asset that pays, say, $100 a year in real terms would have been worth a real $1,429 in 1984, when it yielded 7%, but would have to be worth a real $5,000 now, when it yields just 2%.
A decline in long-term rates of such magnitude would thus appear to imply massive price inflation for real assets, justifying the high prices we are in fact seeing.
Case closed, according to some advocates of pricey investments.
But there are holes in this case.
We have to look at the reasons that real interest rates were so much higher 10 or 20 years ago, and think about what that means, and we also have to look at the broader history of asset prices and their relation to real interest rates.
Twenty years ago, real short-term interest rates were exceptionally high by historical standards because the major central banks of the world wanted to combat what was seen at the time as inaction against spiraling inflation.
It took the courage – or recklessness, depending on your point of view – of US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to send the world into recession in 1981-2 in order to break the back of inflation.
That recession was destructive, but it had one silver lining: an inspiration to the world that an independent central bank can take tough measures to ensure price stability.
Hence, real long-term rates remained quite high in the mid-1980’s.
But this history means that the true real long-term interest rate was not as high in the 1980’s as our measures show, because long-term inflation expectations must have been much higher than the one-year inflation rate was at the time.
Holders of long-term bonds, for example, must have thought that inflation would come roaring back after the effects of the 1981-2 global recession had passed.
The inflation-indexed bond markets were not well developed in the 1980’s.
But we do know that in 1984 the best-developed such market (in the United Kingdom) was quoting long-term real interest rates of only around 3% – far below the IMF’s figure.
Even if we were to accept that real rates were genuinely very high in the mid-1980’s, then the logical conclusion would be that the stock and housing markets should have been even lower in the 1980’s, not that real prices should be very high in 2005.
In fact, if one takes a longer view of real interest rates in the US, calculated by subtracting the previous year’s inflation from the nominal government bond yield, one finds that, while they are much lower than 20 years ago, they are not low by historical standards.
The average real long-term government interest rate in 1891-1979 – a period ending just before Volcker oversaw soaring growth in borrowing costs – was a mere 1.25%, which is very close to the real long-term interest rate today.
Historically, real rates have jumped around a lot, showing little correlation with asset prices.
Elections are Not Enough
Or to a president of Venezuela whose intolerance of the business class causes jubilation in the streets, but emigration by those whose initiative is crucial for the welfare of the people.
Less damaging, yet problematic, is the election – as in Poland – of a minority government that ruthlessly pursues its members’ personal interests and breaks all promises of cooperation made before the polls.
Elections can lead to illiberal democracies and worse.
They must be embedded in a much more complex institutional framework, which I would describe as the liberal order.
This is where rules that impose term limits on officeholders, such as the Twenty-Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, have their place.
Many constitutions contain such a rule, and even President Vladimir Putin of Russia has stated that he will abide by it.
Elsewhere, notably in many of the Soviet Union’s other successor states and in Latin America, those in power have often simply changed the constitution – including rules on term limits – to their advantage.
This is where the second pillar of a liberal order comes into play: the rule of law.
It cannot be said too often that democracy and the rule of law are not the same thing.
There are lawless democracies and undemocratic “states of law” (Rechtsstaat).
It is extremely important that Iraq held elections to a constitutional assembly.
This has produced – albeit with a certain amount of external pressure notably on behalf of the Sunnis – a document that may provide the basis for the rule of law.
But the task of finding, appointing, and accepting independent judges remains.
It will be particularly difficult in an environment in which the sharia – that is, Islamic religious law administered not by judges but by priests – is never far away.
Even then, we know from history that it takes but one Enabling Law to unhinge the rule of law and replace it by an ideological tyranny, as happened when Hitler came to power in Germany.
A plurality of civic associations and activities – regulated but not controlled by the state, and free to express its views and even to demonstrate its (diverse) sentiments publicly – is the most powerful pillar of a liberal order.
However, there is no ultimate guarantee against the abuse of power, especially if that power is democratically gained.
The program of spreading the liberal order requires a much more sophisticated approach.
Above all, it requires international agencies and groupings that remain alert to the risks of illiberal democracies.
For Turkey, For Europe
Turkey is now, finally, negotiating with the European Commission the terms of its possible membership in the European Union.
But whether “possible” becomes “eventual” remains very much an open question.
Recall that Turkey made its first application to join in 1959, and that since 1963, the European Economic Community, the forerunner to today’s EU, responded with a delaying tactic: a request for a customs agreement.
At the same time, having never had to take “no” for an answer – and after receiving a series of nods and winks that hinted that membership might one day come – Turkey’s expectation of eventual EU integration became increasingly palpable.
But ordinary Europeans have begun looking at maps, and the geography that they see cannot be denied: 95% of Turkey’s territory and 80% of its population is in Asia.
As a result, the fierce and lively debate – in Turkey and much more emphatically in the EU – about whether Turkey really belongs to Europe has continued, despite the start of negotiations.
On the contrary, “the Turkish Question” will be resolved on the basis of the current political preoccupations and concerns for the future.
Fortunately, that choice was not settled prematurely and peremptorily: the process that will lead to a final decision was merely allowed to start with the opening of negotiations.
Membership talks can’t help but be long and arduous, if only because adopting the acquis communautaire (the body of EU law) requires that Turkey integrate around 10,000 pages of texts into its legislation.
With 67 million people today, and a population that will reach 80 million in 20 years and 100 million in 2050, Turkey is bound to become the most populous of all European nations.
But the immigrants have been mostly poor peasants from Anatolia, whose integration has proven to be difficult.
Europe, then, is frightened by the prospect of more immigration by Turks who find it almost impossible to assimilate.
For the moment, such immigration has almost stopped, owing to rapid economic growth – indeed, the fastest in Europe – in recent years, which is absorbing the country’s available labor and has thus stemmed the flow of emigrants.
Economic fears are not the only concern for EU citizens.
Turkey was the theater of exceptional violence in the twentieth century: its participation in WWI fueled hatred and gigantic massacres, with the genocide of the Armenians the last vicious spasm of the Ottoman Empire’s brutal demise.
Moreover, while Kemal Ataturk restored Turkish national pride by creating the secular Turkish republic, his legacy is mixed, for it includes both Turkey’s strong attraction to the West and a militarization of public life.
The latter explains much of the repressive attitude towards free speech and independent opinion that has characterized much of Turkish public life – a straitjacket that has left little room for real negotiations with Turkey’s restless Kurds or for resolving the division of Cyprus.
But Turkey’s EU aspirations mean that it is now being forced to demilitarize its democracy and to find negotiated and peaceful agreements with all its neighbors and future partners – Armenians, Kurds, and Cypriots.
Thus, if Europe manages to overcome its fears and hesitations and open itself to a powerful Muslim state, it will consolidate peace in one of the world’s most dangerous regions.
Indeed, by integrating Turkey, Europe would show that it is not a Christian club, that the supposed “clash of civilizations” need not be fatal, and that the European project, born out of a desire for reconciliation and the need to promote development, can spread its benefits far beyond the Western half of Europe.
In opening itself to Turkey, the EU would finally begin to play its proper role in confronting today’s most daunting political challenges.
Free Speech on Trial
Not so long ago, there was jubilation that the free world and its values had prevailed in the Cold War.
When the Communist empire collapsed, some even announced that the victory of liberty and democracy implied the “end of history.”
But history never bowed out; at most, it only took a decade-long intermission, with its next act heralded by the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001.
And here the plot has thickened.
Since 9/11, more and more freedoms are being restricted in the name of defending liberty.
New visa requirements and other obstacles to travel, more intimate data collected by governments, and the presence of video cameras everywhere – at once benign and intrusive – remind one more of George Orwell’s Big Brother than of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty.
Britain is not the only country where ancient rights of habeas corpus, of the inviolability of the person, are to be restricted by new legislation that, for example, extends the permissible length of detention without charge.
Now, even the fundamental right of a liberal order, free speech, is under pressure.
In the prison library, however, Irving found two of the books he had written that had led to his arrest!
In Berlin, there is much concern about the possible desecration of the Holocaust Memorial, although its author, the American architect Peter Eisenmann, takes a relaxed view of what is said and done about his creation.
In the Netherlands, the shock that arose over the killing of the film maker Theo van Gogh runs deep and has led to demands for legislation against hate speech.
In Britain, proposed legislation concerning incitement to religious hatred and terrorism has led to emotional parliamentary debates – and to doubts about the liberal credentials of Tony Blair’s government.
The first and principled answer must surely be no.
All freedoms can be abused by liberty’s enemies, but in the case of speech, the risk posed by restricting freedom is surely greater.
Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has demonstrated that free speech even helps mitigate seemingly natural catastrophes like famines, because it reveals the ways in which a few haves exploit the many have-nots.
Nowadays, we worry about incitement ­– using free speech to provoke violence.
I do not know how many Islamic leaders preach murder and mayhem in mosques and help recruit suicide bombers from among their congregants; but even if it is only a handful, they pose a question that must be answered.
In my view, Holocaust denial should not be outlawed, in contrast to the demand for all, or any, Jews to be killed.
Similarly, attacks against the West in mosques, however vicious, should not be banned, in contrast to open encouragement to join suicide death squads.
What about the mere praise of “martyrs” who have died while murdering others?
The boundary between implicit and explicit incitement is not easily drawn, but, again, it should be wider rather than narrower.
Both require active and alert citizens who engage what they do not like rather than calling for the state to clamp down on it.
From People Power to Putin Power
As I attended a small but dignified memorial ceremony in Paris last week in honor of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya – a woman “brave beyond limits,” in the words of her French editor – I was reminded of another posthumous tribute I participated in nearly 17 years ago in Moscow.
Unlike Politkovskaya, the great scientist and human right activist Andrei Sakharov had not been murdered, and the tribute given to him then looked like the celebration of a new era.
What the small crowd of intellectuals gathered in Paris was mourning was their hope for a different Russia.
We were burying the collective dream of intellectuals and democrats for a Russia where freedom and the rule of law would, after a long and cold Soviet winter, take root and bloom.
The balance of terror of the Soviet era has given way to unilateral energy dependency in favor of Russia.
The Iranian regime is highly ideological and animated by an open passion to destroy Israel.
It does not enjoy the massive backing of its society, except when it comes to national pride and the quest for nuclear status.
His motto, “Get rich and keep quiet,” sounds like Guizot’s priorities in mid-nineteenth century France, even if it is “seasoned” with a strong touch of imperial pride.
As long as the oil money keeps flowing, most Russians will express no nostalgia for the democratic opening of the Yeltsin years, with its accompanying combination of chaos, corruption, international weakness, and disrespect for the state.
In their quest for post-Soviet stability, Russians seem to have found reassurance in Putin.
For a majority of Russian citizens, economic prosperity and televised entertainment have become the modern equivalent of the panem et circenses formula of Roman times.
The war in Chechnya may contribute to the moral corruption of Russia as a whole, to its frightening descent into a culture of violence.
The multiplication of assassinations of political opponents and economic rivals, the mafia practice of contract murders, cannot be seen as signs of a regained stability.
Russia may have recovered its status as a strong power, but is it a respected, or even a happy one?
Russia is rich, but Russians, at least most of them, remain poor, with a life expectancy that is closer to Africa than to Western Europe.
Germany’s Five Election Unknowns
Fortunately, politics is not mathematics – though, unfortunately, this means that there are no clear solutions.
Indeed, even in the opaque terms of contemporary politics, the German case is particularly vexing.
The first unknown is why the election is taking place at all.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had another fifteen months to go before the end of the electoral term, and it seemed that he had no difficulty mobilizing his admittedly slender majority in parliament.
To be sure, the big issues that the Federal President listed when he dissolved the Bundestag are real.
The fiscal position is, by German standards, unacceptable, and public debt at current levels is contrary to the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact and a burden on future generations.
None of this is new, nor will it be changed by an election.
So it is not obvious to many people why they are voting.
The second unknown concerns what, exactly, separates the major parties in this contest.
The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (CDU) are both committed to the “social market economy,” to the essentials of corporatist economic management, to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state, and to the EU and NATO.
Schröder’s SPD uses the word “social” a little more emphatically than it did in the last seven years.
The opposition CDU leader, Angela Merkel, has linked its program to the ambitious ideas of an outsider, former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof, seeking a dramatic simplification of the tax system.
In international affairs, Merkel is more skeptical about European enlargement, notably to include Turkey, than Schröder.
Merkel, an East German by background, is also more cautious in her approach to Russia.
The third unknown is the performance of the Left Party, a new formation positioned to the left of the SPD and built on East Germany’s ex-communist PDS, with the addition of a significant number of dissident Social Democrats in the West who proclaim themselves to be defenders of the welfare state.
The Left Party is led by two talk show politicians, Gregor Gysi, the former PDS leader, and Oskar Lafontaine, the ex-leader of the SPD, who do not have much more in common than a record of political failure and a talent for populist speeches.
But this clearly appeals to those who feel that they have been neglected and forgotten.
It will also be a government without the Greens, who continue to have a devoted, if limited, clientele, but are now regarded by many as a luxury that Germany can no longer afford.
This leaves two possibilities: a coalition between the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the liberal Free Democrats, or a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU.
But most people doubt whether it even makes a difference, and they are probably right.
There is a widespread desire for change, including a change of government, but there is an equally widespread belief that nothing momentous will happen.
This underscores the final, and deepest, unknown concerning the upcoming election: who will put a confused and directionless Germany back on a road to initiative and growth?
Who will make Germany an engine of Europe again rather than a gloomy passenger?
It needs to accept that globalization is above all an opportunity, one that must be grasped by confident, innovative, and entrepreneurial people.
Germans need to understand again – as they did so well after 1945 – that their future lies in their own hands, as citizens, rather than in the power of some remote State.
Above all, Germany must appreciate that the changes it needs are improvements that would guarantee its future security.
Islam as a Tool of Modernization
But Malaysian history over the past three decades shows that this belief is mistaken.
In fact, Islamization has proved to be an effective political means of reconciling the majority of Malays to the country’s rapid economic development.
After three decades of spectacular economic growth, many Malays have become prosperous and content not only through secular capitalism, but through the country’s renewed sense of Islamic identity, one which – for the most part – embraced modernization.
Islamic-minded politicians such as Anwar Ibrahim gained prominence when Islamization took off in the 1970’s.
But the Islam they promoted was not backward looking; instead, it sought to shape a modernizing economic policy that took note of Muslim sensibilities.
Faced with the grassroots popularity of this movement, by 1982 the government of then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed decided to co-opt Anwar Ibrahim into his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party within the country’s ruling coalition.
The strategy worked well, and helped defuse Islamic opposition to the wrenching changes that accompanied the country’s rapid economic modernization.
During the 1990’s, however, Anwar increased his influence within the party, unsettling many of the old guard.
Matters came to a head after the 1997 financial crisis, when Anwar, the deputy prime minister, adopted an even more economically liberal approach than Mahathir.
Anwar’s bizarre trial and sentencing on charges of sodomy and abuse of power invigorated the reformasi movement, as growing anti-UMNO and anti-Mahathir sentiments took hold among Islamic-minded Malays.
This culminated in poor electoral results for the ruling coalition in November 1999.
The Islamist party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), took power in the states of Kelantan and Trengganu and strongly threatened UMNO in other northern states.
The personal conflict between Mahathir and Anwar thus led to an apparent rupture between Malaysia’s Islamist political forces and the modernizers of UMNO.
This impulse strongly affected his choice of a successor when he decided to step down as prime minister.
It was the beginning of America’s global “war on terror” in 2001, however, that brought the political march of the Islamist parties to a screeching halt, as it provided an excuse for the government to crack down on the Malay right and the PAS.
So, before stepping down, Mahathir went so far as to declare Malaysia a de facto Muslim state.
Eyebrows were raised and questions were asked about the lengths to which Mahathir would go to counteract the Islamist appeal.
This vague term was finally fleshed out with a list of ten principles in September 2004, all but one of which, however, was without religious connotations.
Nevertheless, this move appeared to be all that was needed for Islam-minded voters to return to the fold of the ruling front.
In the general election in March 2004 – the first since Mahathir stepped down after 22 years in power – moderate Muslims helped Abdullah Badawi to a landslide victory.
The release of Anwar Ibrahim soon afterwards raised the new premier’s prestige further as a leader who could heal intra-Malay, and intra-Muslim, conflicts.
Since then, Abdullah Badawi has been popularizing the concept of “Hadhari,” shaping it as a means to shift Islam’s focus from its sanctioning function to its civilizing potential and rendering it less ideological.
In Malaysia today, Islam is being presented as a generator of civilization and culture, and not merely as a source of religious inspiration.
With various feints and strategies, Malaysia has effectively managed the tensions between a secular, modernizing agenda and the Islamic faith that the Malays profess.
By making Islamists and Islamist sentiments a part of the process of modernization, Malaysia demonstrates that Islamic faith and economic growth can be reconciled if politicians are clever enough not to treat them as contradictions.
Islam’s Forsaken Renaissance
One whispers something to his neighbor, who then whispers that information to the next child, and so on, around the circle.
The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, brought one – and only one – religion.
Yet today we have perhaps a thousand religions that all claim to be Islam.
The Shia/Sunni schism is so deep that each side condemns followers of the other as apostates, kafir.
The Sunnis have four imams and the Shias have twelve; their teachings all differ.
But what is it that we must believe when each branch of Islam thinks the other one is wrong?
The Koran, after all, is one book, not two or three, or a thousand.
According to the Koran, a Muslim is anyone who bears witness that “there is no God (Allah) but Allah, and that Muhammad is his Rasul (Messenger).”
If no other qualification is added, then all those who subscribe to these precepts must be regarded as Muslims.
But perhaps the greatest problem is the progressive isolation of Islamic scholarship – and much of Islamic life – from the rest of the modern world.
We live in an age of science in which people can see around corners, hear and see things happening in outer space, and clone animals.
This is so because those who interpret the Koran are learned only in religion, in its laws and practices, and thus are usually unable to understand today’s scientific miracles.
The fatwas (legal opinions concerning Islamic law) that they issue appear unreasonable and cannot be accepted by those with scientific knowledge.
Others assert that the world was created 2,000 years ago.
The age of the universe and its size measured in light years – these are things that the purely religiously trained ulamas cannot comprehend.
Today’s oppression, the killings and the humiliations of Muslims, occurs because we are weak, unlike the Muslims of the past.
We can feel victimized and criticize the oppressors, but to stop them we need to look at ourselves.
Indeed, there was no “Muslim scholarship” at the time, so to read meant to read whatever was available.
The early Muslims read the works of the great Greek scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers.
Muslim scholars added to the body of knowledge and developed new disciplines, such as astronomy, geography, and new branches of mathematics.
They introduced numerals, enabling simple and limitless calculations.
They began to study religion alone, insisting that only those who study religion – particularly Islamic jurisprudence – gain merit in the afterlife.
And so, as Muslims were intellectually regressing, Europeans began their renaissance, developing improved ways of meeting their needs, including the manufacture of weapons that eventually allowed them to dominate the world.
By contrast, Muslims fatally weakened their ability to defend themselves by neglecting, even rejecting, the study of allegedly secular science and mathematics, and this myopia remains a fundamental source of the oppression suffered by Muslims today.
Many Muslims still condemn the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kamal, because he tried to modernize his country.
Failure to understand and interpret the true and fundamental message of the Koran has brought only misfortune to Muslims.
By limiting our reading to religious works and neglecting modern science, we destroyed Islamic civilization and lost our way in the world.
The Koran says that “Allah will not change our unfortunate situation unless we make the effort to change it.”
Many Muslims continue to ignore this and, instead, merely pray to Allah to save us, to bring back our lost glory.
Jihad or Murder?
It is remarkable that some of the most critical concepts of Muslim religious terminology have now become part of the international language of current affairs.
Questions drawn from Islamic theology are discussed freely by the world public, engaging specialists and non-specialists, Muslims and non-Muslims.
For example, the term jihad, commonly translated as “holy war,” has become nearly ubiquitous.
Though conceived in early Muslim history as a means of spreading God’s word, Muslim scholars today distinguish between two kinds of jihad – one being an internal struggle against temptation, and the other a physical conflict against an aggressor who threatens the survival or the fundamental rights of a Muslim community.
Numerous Muslim scholars have raised their voices to challenge the terrorists’ defense of suicide bombings or attacks on civilians, offering long citations from centuries of religious jurisprudence.
In itself, this approach represents a worthy expression of collective conscience in opposition to the terrorists.
Muslim intellectuals are being encouraged to press the religious argument against fundamentalist violence in order to deprive the terrorists of their most fearsome and potent arguments.
If Muslim scholars can somehow disprove these arguments, it is thought, then the terrorists’ ability to sustain their violent underground will be reduced.
Looking more closely, one finds that while these controversies were often framed in religious terms, they were not at all about religion.
Recently, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he found scholars who raised theological arguments on his behalf.
The coalition confronting him had no difficulty finding religious arguments that led to precisely the opposite conclusion.
Today, it is clear that fundamentalists and their supporters are completely closed off to even the most elaborate theological refutation of their views, even when produced by distinguished religious authorities.
The first reflex of the fundamentalists is to withdraw from the mainstream, to build around themselves a shell that is impervious to any logic other than their own.
The most essential questions that humans face today – those that engender the deepest conflicts – have nothing to do with theology.
They concern disputes over territory, political power, definitions of rights, and distribution of wealth.
Why, then, do we follow the fundamentalists to the very heart of their madness?
Allowing them to frame these problems in religious terms legitimizes the perspective that they are attempting to impose, particularly in their own societies.It also allows them to camouflage their very worldly thirst for power.
In fact, debates about the use of religious terms lend credibility to fundamentalist efforts to apply these ideas to conditions in the modern world.
Such debates concede that these religious concepts are generally valid, even when, as in the fundamentalists’ case, they simply do not apply.
Invariably, fundamentalists dismiss religious critiques of their views as evidence that religious authorities have been corrupted by hostile influences.
In this way, the terrorists oppose the “purity” and “authenticity” of their arguments to the compromises presumably forced upon religious establishments.
Speaking to Muslims exclusively in their own religious terms also excludes them from broad ethical frameworks that defend essential human values, most notably the protection of innocent civilians.
These values are the foundation upon which all religious and cultural traditions rest.
It may even be that religious language does not adequately express the repulsion we all feel toward the terrorists’ actions.
No feeling of victimhood can justify, under any conditions, such crimes against innocents, and no theology can accept the negation of the human essence that we all share.
Kuwaiti Democracy in Action
Kuwait has just held its eleventh parliamentary election since independence in 1961.
Though Kuwait is a monarchy, its parliamentary history has not been placid, and the election campaign reflected ongoing tensions between the royal family and segments of the electorate.
Originally scheduled for October 2007, the election was brought forward to break a deadlock between the parliament and the government over the number of electoral districts in the country.
Currently, there are 25 constituencies nationwide, but reformers have long argued that a smaller number – each with a larger number of voters – would be less susceptible to manipulation by the political elite.
The 29 members of parliament who support a reduced number of constituencies were unable to agree with the government on a new number.
As a result, the issue became the focus of a vigorous campaign by discontented Kuwaitis, who gathered in front of the National Assembly building and in universities to voice their criticisms.
In response, the government removed the redistricting issue from parliament to the constitutional court – an attempt, reformers argued, to hold back change.
When three members of parliament sought to question the Prime Minister – their right, under the Kuwaiti constitution – the parliament was dissolved and elections called.
The rules of political life in Kuwait have been worked out over 300 years – since this small area emerged as a self-contained polity.
The royal family is empowered to administer the country, but through consultation with different sectors, like tribal leaders or merchant groups.
With independence in 1961, these rules were codified in a constitution.
Compared to other Gulf monarchies, the Kuwaiti royal family has limited powers, though constitutional rules have frequently been ignored—charges of vote-rigging marred the 1967 election, and parliamentary dissolution has dotted the country’s history.
Nevertheless, since the liberation of Kuwait following the Iraqi occupation in August 1990, the parliament has gained both stability and respect.
The dissolutions of parliament in 1999 and 2006 were carried out according to the law, and elections were called in a timely fashion.
Parliament retains the right to interrogate cabinet members, including the Prime Minister, on financial and administrative questions and has frequently passed motions of no confidence in government.
More recently, with the death last December of the Emir, Sheikh Jabir al-Ahmad, parliamentary approval was exercised a key role in resolving succession debates among factions of the royal family.
Though political parties have not been legalized, they are nonetheless active in parliament and public life.
Kuwaiti life reflects the many and varied political trends throughout the Arab world, as the country’s open society and economic opportunities have made it a powerful magnet and regional safety valve since the 1950’s.
With this election, Kuwaiti women participated in choosing the parliament for the first time.
Though women have long been active in Kuwaiti public life, they were enfranchised only last year, after a long and difficult campaign, by a parliamentary vote, and accounted for just 28 of the 249 candidates.
Clearly, women demonstrated tremendous enthusiasm for the political process, taking part in large numbers in political rallies, and as campaign workers in a range of election activities.
Most Kuwaitis see this very technical issue as a way of pressing for reform.
Major regional issues, like the war in Iraq or Iran’s nuclear program, were barely mentioned.
However, Islamists were among the 29 parliamentary deputies pushing for constituency reform, a fact that eased their dilemma.
It can go along with electoral reform, or it can find an opportunity to dissolve the new parliament.
Whatever the immediate outcome, the Kuwaiti government is facing a new political horizon.
Women are now the majority of voters, and young people have taken up the reform banner.
Kuwait’s Parliamentary Revolution
But a different assertion of democratic and parliamentary power, this time in the Gulf sheikdom of Kuwait, which possesses 10% of world oil reserves, may prove to be equally important.
Every sign indicates that the wave of democratization in Kuwait is irreversible, and the impact of these changes extends beyond Kuwait to all the other oil-rich Gulf countries, which are also ruled by emirs and sheikhs.
The death of Kuwait’s ruler, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, on January 15, 2006, was followed by unprecedented national disquiet, which led to the rapid abdication of his designated successor, Saad Al Sabah.
Nothing like this had ever hit the Al Sabah family, which has ruled Kuwait for two centuries.
The succession was always strictly a family affair, and any disputes remained behind closed doors.
However, with Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah’s death, the succession was not only subjected to feverish public debate, but the Kuwaiti press and Parliament were key actors in determining the outcome.
Kuwait’s political system is considered the most modern among the Arab Gulf sheikhdoms and monarchies, because all citizens – men and women alike – elect its parliament.
Elections with universal suffrage, combined with a relatively free press, meant that the succession became a public issue, debated in the media and by academics for months as Sheikh Jaber was dying.
With the taboo on discussing the succession broken, talk about the physical and mental fitness of the likely successor became commonplace, and members of the ruling family who objected to the prospect of being ruled by a severely incapacitated crown prince came to enjoy broad support.
Thus, immediately after Jaber al-Sabah’s death, the succession became a national concern.
What in the past would have been a straightforward palace coup spilled out onto the pages of newspapers and into the corridors of Parliament.
For the first time, an Arab parliament had voted a head of state out of office and asserted its will in choosing the successor.
Parliamentary supremacy, one of the key issues in any country’s democratization, appears to be at hand in Kuwait.
Of course, Kuwait will now experience enormous tensions between the transparent rule of a true parliamentary government and the still powerful legacy of a hidden family-run state.
But the old rule of force and intrigue by which other Gulf rulers have been deposed has been replaced by a modern principle – the Al Sabah have surrendered their exclusive control over the succession to the will of Parliament, which alone could provide the legitimacy that the new Emir needs.
The consequences of this assertion of parliamentary authority will be enormous.
Parliamentary ratification did not simply provide a rubber stamp to a palace coup; its approval was conditional. Emirs who need parliamentary approval to secure popular legitimacy must now reckon with the need to share power.
In exchange for voting to pass over the unfit Crown Prince, Kuwait’s parliament is now demanding even more political and economic reforms, including the formal legalization of political parties, the separation of the position of prime minister from that of crown prince, and even for the prime minister to be chosen from outside the Al Sabah family.
This was a true parliamentary revolution.
The delay is significant, because Kuwaitis are unaccustomed to this kind of parliamentary influence.
But Kuwait shows that there will invariably come a moment when holding onto feudal ways is no longer an option.
Morocco’s Veiled Feminists
It is often assumed that modern feminism has no place, and thus can make little headway, in societies undergoing a religious revival, particularly in the Islamic world.
But the real progress made in recent years on women’s rights in Morocco suggests otherwise: a unique combination of activism by secular and religious women, the calculations of political parties, and a significant role for the King has led to real progress.
By and large representative of a liberal perspective, they nonetheless recognized the importance of Islam throughout Moroccan society.
This first generation of Moroccan feminists was guided by a key insight: the interactions of men and women were not dictated by religion, but by social practices that had often used religion as a means of reinforcement.
For example, women and their sexual purity were linked with the honor of men and their families – a connection that was defended by grounding it in Islam.
Like many Muslim countries in this new era, Morocco began to experience a revitalization of political Islam.
Better educated and more in touch with global currents through the media or their own travel, women began participating in Moroccan political debates.
As a result, the veil became a mechanism for making their presence felt publicly and gaining credibility within religious debates.
For many men, Islamist or not, the veil remains a sign of Islamic affiliation and traditional piety.
Liberal Moroccan feminists understand this use of the veil by many Moroccan women, and they have encouraged a dialogue with veiled activists from the Islamist camp.
The signs of cooperation have been clear: increasing use of Arabic, rather than French, discussions that incorporate real knowledge of Islamic scripture, and recognition that Islam remains distinct from traditional practices.
At the same time, liberal feminists began to invest more effort in civic associations, rather than political parties.
This broadened their focus to Moroccan society as a whole and questions of how people could be empowered to improve their lives.
All of this comes at a time of greater political openness and democratization: the first ever socialist government in 1998, a younger and more open King – described by democrats of both sexes of Morocco’s “first feminist” – who took the throne in 1999, and a quota system that brought 35 women into the Parliament in 2002.
Women are increasingly making the argument that they have been deliberately excluded from a full role in society not because Islam prescribes it, but because Islam was revealed in a deeply patriarchal social context.
The women’s movement in Morocco – which now bridges secular and religious communities – is setting an example of the power of social thought in a traditional society.
Re-visiting traditional interpretations of Scripture is not the end of the story.
Women’s advocacy has also shaped a new approach to poverty alleviation in Morocco, in the form of the National Initiative for Human Development, which integrates efforts to improve education with better sanitation and housing.
It is no exaggeration to say that the Moroccan women’s movement has become the cutting edge of reform, engaging Islamization, modernization, democratization, and feminism.
North Korea Makes History
Historical turning points are normally easier to identify in retrospect.
But it will not require years to determine whether North Korea’s test of a nuclear explosive device qualifies as one.
Some argue that little has changed as a result of the test.
The world assumed for years that North Korea possesses enough nuclear material to make a half-dozen or more basic nuclear bombs.
So much has changed.
North Korea has challenged the world; the question is how the world responds.
North Korea’s leaders have a history of aggressiveness, a demonstrated contempt for their people, and a record of selling just about anything (from drugs and counterfeit dollars to missile parts) to earn hard currency.
The danger is that they might be tempted to use a nuclear weapon, act irresponsibly in the belief that such weapons shield them, or sell one to terrorists.
Northeast Asia is a dynamic arena, home to many of the world’s powers, including China, Russia, Japan, the two Koreas, and in many ways the United States.
How the world responds to North Korea is likely to affect the calculations of other would-be nuclear powers, including Iran.
Maintaining peace in a world in which literally dozens of fingers are on nuclear triggers will be far more difficult—and the consequences of failure far more destructive.
Initial reactions to North Korea’s nuclear test were uniformly critical, culminating (thus far) in UN Security Council Resolution 1718, which condemns the test, demands that North Korea resume full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and imposes a range of military, political, and economic sanctions.
Nevertheless, North Korea’s leaders are clearly betting that they can get away with what they have done, and that the world will get used to their nuclear weapons program, much as it did with Israel, India, and Pakistan.
South Korea’s “Sunshine Policy” is best understood as “unconditional engagement.”
Not surprisingly, this “all carrot, no stick” approach has failed to affect North Korean behavior.
China, for its part, has made clear that it does not intend to inspect cargo moving in and out of North Korea across their long common border to ensure it does not contain items prohibited by Resolution 1718.
While China opposes North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, it is even more opposed to policies that could threaten the North’s stability and lead to massive refugee crossings into China or to a unified Korea with its capital in Seoul.
The problem is that it would almost surely trigger a massive, costly war, and it would not necessarily succeed in destroying all of North Korea’s hidden capabilities.
Moreover, both China and South Korea strongly oppose such a scenario, while the United States is poorly positioned to implement it, given its involvement in Iraq.
The danger is less that North Korea might use nuclear weapons (although it might) than that it might sell them.
President Bush’s warning that “the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States, and we would hold North Korea fully accountable of the consequences of such action,” is meant to deter this outcome.
North Korea would be expected to give up its nuclear weapons and place its nuclear material under international safeguards in exchange for formal security assurances, energy resources, and a range of political and economic benefits.
Such efforts should be renewed as soon as possible; the US should agree to bilateral as well as six-party talks with the North, possibly in exchange for a moratorium on nuclear tests.
It will take a blend of the three options – the threat of military force, the reality of economic sanctions, and the resumption of diplomacy —to deal with North Korea’s challenge.
This will not be easy, but it is worth pursuing, because the alternative—a desperate, hostile, nuclear-armed, and isolated North Korea—should alarm everyone.
Parties and Populists
This is not a good time for political parties, especially those with traditional orientations.
Gone are the times in the older democracies when one could count on two major parties – one social democratic, the other more to the right of center – dominating the political scene.
The old proletariat and the old bourgeoisie are gone.
Instead we see what has sometimes been called a “levelled-in middle-class society,” albeit one with an important elite of the super-rich at one end and an underclass at the other.
This means that their interests vary as situations change.
It also means that they no longer find a political home in parties, but react to situations, to vague moods, and above all to appeals to sentiments, if not resentments.
In some cases, they are individuals like President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela (and other Latin American leaders) or Italy’s ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Mostly they enter the political scene from the fringes but manage to form a highly personalized grouping, like Jörg Haider and his Austrian Freedom Party, Jean-Marie LePen and his French Nationalists, Andrzej Lepper and his Polish Peasant Party, or Prime Minister Robert Fico and his Direction in Slovakia.
One is that a surprising number of populist leaders have managed to get themselves into power in recent years.
Their success reflects the electorate’s uncertainties and, increasingly, the perceived injustices of globalization, as well as the fear of many about minorities, immigrants, and foreigners in general.
These populists promise solutions that dispense with the habits and norms of moderation, notably with centrist democratic policies and an internationalism that seeks to promote peace and prosperity.
One sometimes wonders whether we are experiencing not so much the end of history as the end of enlightened history, perhaps of the enlightenment itself.
Beyond that, populist episodes are signs of an underlying instability that neither serves national progress nor contributes to international order.
Austria paid a price for its Haider interlude, and France did not exactly benefit from the runoff between President Jacques Chirac and Le Pen in the last Presidential election.
Political parties have had a bad press in recent years, and there are good reasons for this.
Still, they do fulfill a useful function by bundling interests and issues, thereby providing an element of stability in the political system.
Those structures are gone forever, but a liberal-democratic order cannot succeed through situational politics built on popular resentments.
It requires a sense of the medium term and a commitment to rational debate of issues, for one tradition that can be revived – that of enlightened thinking – is the most important of all.
Rethinking Sovereignty
For 350 years, sovereignty – the notion that states are the central actors on the world stage and that governments are essentially free to do what they want within their own territory but not within the territory of other states – has provided the organizing principle of international relations.
The time has come to rethink this notion.
The sovereign state is influenced by them (for better and for worse) as much as it is able to influence them.
As a result, new mechanisms are needed for regional and global governance that include actors other than states.
This is not to argue that Microsoft, Amnesty International, or Goldman Sachs be given seats in the United Nations General Assembly, but it does mean including representatives of such organizations in regional and global deliberations when they have the capacity to affect whether and how regional and global challenges are met.
This is already taking place in the trade realm.
Governments agree to accept the rulings of the World Trade Organization because on balance they benefit from an international trading order even if a particular decision requires that they alter a practice that is their sovereign right to carry out.
Under one such arrangement, the Kyoto Protocol, which runs through 2012, signatories agree to cap specific emissions.
At its core, globalization entails the increasing volume, velocity, and importance of flows – within and across borders – of people, ideas, greenhouse gases, goods, dollars, drugs, viruses, emails, weapons, and a good deal else, challenging one of sovereignty’s fundamental principles: the ability to control what crosses borders in either direction.
Sovereign states increasingly measure their vulnerability not to one another, but to forces beyond their control.
Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker.
States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves, because they cannot insulate themselves from what goes on elsewhere.
Imagine how the world would react if some government were known to be planning to use or transfer a nuclear device or had already done so.
Necessity may also lead to reducing or even eliminating sovereignty when a government, whether from a lack of capacity or conscious policy, is unable to provide for the basic needs of its citizens.
This reflects not simply scruples, but a view that state failure and genocide can lead to destabilizing refugee flows and create openings for terrorists to take root.
The NATO intervention in Kosovo was an example where a number of governments chose to violate the sovereignty of another government (Serbia) to stop ethnic cleansing and genocide.
By contrast, the mass killing in Rwanda a decade ago and now in Darfur, Sudan, demonstrate the high price of judging sovereignty to be supreme and thus doing little to prevent the slaughter of innocents.
If a state fails to live up to its side of the bargain by sponsoring terrorism, either transferring or using weapons of mass destruction, or conducting genocide, then it forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty and opens itself up to attack, removal, or occupation.
The basic idea of sovereignty, which still provides a useful constraint on violence between states, needs to be preserved.
Russian Realities
At first glance, Russia bears many of the hallmarks of a great power.
It possesses a large arsenal of nuclear weapons, a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, enormous reserves of oil and other minerals, a recent record of robust economic growth, and more territory than any other country despite being only three-fourths the size of the former Soviet Union.
The country’s population now numbers less than Pakistan’s and is declining by 500,000 people per year, leaving large portions of its vast landmass mostly uninhabited.
Male life expectancy is now less than 60 years, owing to alcoholism, crime, drugs, disease, and a dreadful public health system.
There are limits to what Russia can accomplish in the world in any positive sense, although its capacity to be a spoiler or create problems is considerable.
There also must be limits on the power of the central government and the presidency, a degree of regions autonomy, and rule of law – in short, the rudiments of a modern state and democracy.
High energy prices are a boon to Russia’s economy, but, as is often the case in the Middle East and other oil- and gas-rich regions, they can be a burden as well, feeding corruption and discouraging real economic activity.
Russia also needs a national security strategy to complement its political and economic renewal.
All stick and little carrot has failed to quell Chechen nationalism, and President Vladimir Putin’s similarly heavy-handed attempts to control Russia’s so-called “near abroad” – as in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution – have proven no more successful.
Nor will any posture succeed that seeks to put Russia forward as a geopolitical counterweight to the United States.
Such a strategy might be politically satisfying to some, but Russia lacks the resources to compete with the US and needs good bilateral relations in order to proceed with its own internal transformation.
At the same time, the best way to help bring about a more liberal Russia – one that promises to be more stable at home and more responsible abroad – is by working with it.
The outside world can and should support the strengthening of civil society, independent media, and a true transfer of political power in 2008.
Russian membership in the World Trade Organization has the potential to strengthen the rule of law, combat corruption, and give Russia a stake in better relations with the outside world.
Closer ties between Russia and the European Union make sense for similar reasons.
There should also be some understanding for what Russia and the Russian people have gone through over the past two decades.
Losing a country and a special place in the world is the sort of trauma that could lead to the emergence of extreme and potentially violent nationalism.
Its voice should be heard on matters ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation to global climate change and energy policy.
Amid all the attention being devoted to China and the potential for competition or even conflict with the US, it should not be forgotten that Russia’s future hangs in the balance, for history suggests that declining powers can pose as great a challenge to world order as rising ones.
One need only consider Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey at the start of the twentieth century or the former Yugoslavia at its end.
At best, Russia is a potential partner in the effort to manage globalization’s challenges; at worst, it is a potential problem.
What is certain is that how Russia develops will be a key factor determining the character of this century, no less than the last.
Should Shareholders Be Kings?
But it is really a pan-European story, and in economic terms it encompasses the entire world.
Mittal, the biggest steelmaker in the world, has successfully gained control of Arcelor, the second biggest, through what initially was a hostile takeover bid.
These high-quality products are purchased on middle- and long-term contracts, mainly by long-time customers.
Arcelor, one of the oldest steel manufacturers in the world, depends very little on the highly speculative world market for raw steel, and its workforce is (on average) highly qualified and stable.
Mittal, by contrast, is a conglomerate that has come out of nowhere to become the world’s leading steel company in a mere two decades.
It did so by brilliantly consolidating and rationalizing steel plants throughout the world.
This explains why Mittal’s shares are traded in Amsterdam, one of the few stock markets in the world that allows for the listing of companies with so little free-floating capital.
The stakes are much clearer than they usually are in these types of battles.
Mittal has an obvious interest in gaining control of Arcelor in order to improve its global geographic balance, boost its market share in high-end steel products, and reduce its vulnerability to the speculative jolts that occur in the raw steel market.
Its workforce stands to suffer, slowly but surely, from erosion of its relative advantages in terms of wages and job security.
Mittal won.
So the shareholders chose to cash in on a temporary bonus, taking a risk on the progressive erosion of the firm, and perhaps the end of its policy of focusing on high quality while treating its workers with respect.
This choice directly concerns more than 150,000 employees.
Indirectly, it concerns all of us, for the choice made by Arcelor’s shareholders is far from being an exception; on the contrary, it reveals the deep economic and social significance of corporate takeovers of this type.
A system governed by such rules is prone to give rise to various social conflicts, and perhaps to violence.
It would be prudent to adapt the law to this state of facts, and to give employees, too, a say in their destiny.
In the wake of Mittal’s takeover of Arcelor, governments must address this gap in the law, as no society can afford to permit the economic system to continue its march toward indifference to the welfare and security of workers.
Stop Digging And Start Thinking
Was it a test that failed?
The future may provide answers, but the political fallout is clear and the impact substantial.
First, international pressure, led by the US, China, Russia, and Japan was not enough to prevent North Korea from taking this fateful step.
A terrible dictatorship, a regime without a future and a dwarf in terms of power-politics defied the international giants.
But what will be the effect of sanctions against a regime whose goal is survival through self-isolation – a regime that will have no qualms in ruthlessly sacrificing its people?
Also, can China really permit strong sanctions against its neighbor, a regime fighting for survival, one equipped with nuclear arms and missiles, and a humanitarian disaster of the highest order among its population?
This fact will be noted everywhere, particularly in Teheran.
If in these times of militarily-accomplished regime change real sovereignty can only be guaranteed by nuclear arms, why not go this route?
A collapse of the non-proliferation regime will increase not only the risk of regional nuclear arms races, but also of a transfer of nuclear know-how and technology, increasing the risk of nuclear confrontation.
Fourth, the nuclear crisis triggered by North Korea demonstrates that the US – for the first time since the Cold War's end – is no longer the main player on the international scene and that its options are both limited and problematic.
Following the hand-over from Clinton to Bush, the US gave up its strategy of engaging the North Korean regime to moderate its behavior and thus unnecessarily reduced its own options.
Looking to the future, the whole approach to nuclear non-proliferation must change.
It is no use lamenting the real danger of nuclear proliferation, while in practice standing idle as the Non-Proliferation Treaty falls apart.
If the world is not one day to consist of a few big nuclear powers and many mid-sized and small ones, then the big nuclear powers must now undertake a serious disarmament and non-proliferation initiative.
Part of this initiative must be to provide, as a corollary to new disarmament requirements and control mechanisms, the assurance of non-discriminatory access to nuclear know-how, research, and technology.
This will require an international institutional solution to the problem of enrichment, with participation in the enrichment process entailing new obligations, above all, the willingness to assure transparency through verification and intensive inspections.
Moreover, only new strides towards disarmament by the big nuclear powers, and a guarantee of access to technology and know-how under international control, can stop the trend toward “nuclear sovereignty.”
Five years after President Bush called Iraq, Iran, and North Korea an “axis of evil,” developments in these countries remain depressing.
Iraq is a disaster, and nothing indicates that the situation can be turned around.
If to the “axis of evil,” we add Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinians, along with terrorism, the resulting picture is anything but hopeful.
The Culture of Entrepreneurship
Though most business start-ups will never amount to much, each little company is an experiment, and a great deal of experimentation is necessary to produce the occasional firm that can transform a nation’s economy – or even rise to international significance.
In short, entrepreneurship is an incubator, and one that is essential to long-term economic success.
In explaining the variation in levels of entrepreneurship across countries, much attention is devoted nowadays to differences in national attitudes and policies. But there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries.
In a recent study, Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics show the magnitude of differences in levels of entrepreneurship across Swedish municipalities.
They define entrepreneurs as people who report income from a company that they control and work in at least part-time, and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs substantially across the 289 municipalities that they studied, ranging from 1.5% to 18.5%.
What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship?
In the 1980’s and early 1990’s, centralized wage-setting agreements were dissolved and the Swedish government cut personal and corporate tax rates.
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot: religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities. Municipalities tended to have more entrepreneurs if they had a high proportion of pensioners who were members of the Church of Sweden (the official state church until 2000) and a high proportion of right-wing voters.
Beyond that, a feedback mechanism appears to be in place: cities with more entrepreneurs tend to beget still more entrepreneurs.
Once an entrepreneurial culture takes root, it typically spreads locally, as people learn about business and begin to feel attracted by it – even if it doesn’t yield an immediate or certain payoff.
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov discovered that the average income of entrepreneurs was lower in high-entrepreneurship municipalities than in the low-entrepreneurship ones.
Similarly, studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often have lower initial earnings and earnings growth than they would have as employees.
This hypothesis is supported by Giannetti and Simonov, who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs across municipalities may account for differences in levels of entrepreneurship.
In some municipalities, entrepreneurs enjoy high social status, regardless of whether they are already successful; elsewhere they are looked down upon and other occupations are more admired.
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a “worthy person.”
Lamont’s study confirmed the conventional wisdom that Americans value business success, while the French place greater value on culture and quality of life.
Likewise, open contempt of “money-hungry” businesspeople and competition is expressed more often in France than in America.
But, while Lamont focused on differences between the French and the Americans, her study’s most interesting finding was that of significant differences between regions within France.
She compared Clermont-Ferrand, the capital of Auvergne, in the center of France, with Paris.
But the Clermontois valued “simplicity, pragmatism, hard work, and resolve,” while the Parisians put more stress on “pizzazz and brilliance.”
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity.
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a worthy person, and how worthiness is signaled, probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship.
Economists and others often tend to look at countries as a whole and emphasize national attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship.
But, in fact, the national success in entrepreneurship depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies.
The Death of King Fahad
For six weeks, the King lay in a hospital fighting death, something he has done, in reality, ever since he suffered a massive stroke 10 years ago.
Street demonstrations, elections, and political debate in cafes and on the Internet are flowering as never before.
Even the conservative states of the Arabian Peninsula are embroiled in lively disputes about women ministers, Shia representation, Islamist participation in the political process, and even the future of their ruling monarchies.
Indeed, Saudi Arabia seems trapped in a state of suspended animation, its body politic sick and infirm.
The country is caught between two choices: progressive reform or continuing paralysis and decay.
Divisions in the kingdom are sharper than ever, and the King’s death might deepen them further.
Two rival camps - the so-called reformers and the hard liners - are forming in the Al Saud, the world’s largest ruling family, with 22,000 princes and princesses.
Their new leader, King Abdullah, appears to have legitimacy because of his seniority in the family.
Even these limited efforts are obstructed by the hardline Wahhabi camp, which controls the security forces, the judiciary system, and the real levers of domestic power.
Indeed, Prince Naif, the Minister of the Interior and leader of the hardliners, has either silenced or imprisoned hundreds of the key Saudi reformers.
One reason for the weakness of Abdullah’s faction is that he has scant support within the family, because the Al Saud center of power lies with the al Fahads - the six full brothers of the dead King Fahad, most importantly Prince Sultan, the Minister of Defense, and Prince Naif.
On the surface, the succession has proceeded as expected, with Crown Prince Abdullah becoming king now that Fahad has died.
A key early test of Abdullah’s kingship will be if he can succeed in freeing the hundreds of political reformers now in prison, especially three respected academics whom he encouraged to make reform proposals, only to be incarcerated by Naif.
But don’t look for hope in the new generation, which is not necessarily young or progressive.
The sad likelihood is that, given the power of the obstructionists under Naif, a decisive and energetic king is unlikely to emerge.
But Naif (age 77), his full brothers - including Sultan (age 82) - and their supporters within the Wahhabi establishment appear too entrenched to allow that to happen.
Like the geriatric successions that preceded the collapse of the Soviet Union, the succession in Saudi Arabia seems to be only a step in an inexorable march toward political decay.
The Dilemma of Multiculturalism
Many people have suddenly become very hesitant about using the term “multicultural society.”
Or they hesitate to use it approvingly, as a desirable ideal that social reality should at least approximate.
London is certainly a multicultural metropolis.
Sitting, or more likely standing, in the “tube” (as London’s Underground is affectionately known), one never ceases to be amazed at the ease with which Jewish mothers and Muslim men, West Indian youngsters and South Asian businessmen, and many others endure the same stressful conditions and try to lighten its impact by being civil to one another.
The terror attacks demonstrated not only how particular people helped each other, but also how the whole city, with all the ingredients of its human mixture, displayed a common spirit of resilience.
Careful observers have always noted that it is strictly confined to the public sphere, to life in those parts of the city that are shared by all.
It does not extend in quite the same way to people’s homes, let alone to their ways of life in the private sphere.
This is one reason why London has experienced the other, darker side of the multicultural society: the veneer of multiculturalism is thin. It does not take much to turn people of one group against those of others with whom they had apparently lived in peace.
For decades (and in some cases much longer), Serbs and Croats, – indeed, Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim “Yugoslavs” – had lived together as neighbors.
It is important to recognize that we are not talking about the return of age-old hostilities.
Ethnic and cultural conflicts today, often in the form of terrorism, are not the eruption of a supposedly extinct volcano.
Their seamless, all-embracing world of tradition is gone, but they are not yet confident citizens of the modern, individualistic world.
They are not necessarily religious leaders; in the Balkans and elsewhere, they are nationalists who preach the superiority of one nationality over others.
But to call these hate-mongers “preachers” is fitting nonetheless, because they invariably appeal to higher values to sanctify criminal acts.
