It is a far cry even from such doubtful claims as the self-determination of peoples defined as ethnic communities.
Of course, part of the answer is to identify the relatively small number of people who are prepared to use their lives to destroy the lives of others without distinction or purpose.
This will be difficult, and it must not be approached naively.
The Economy of Fear
Is it because, as G-8 leaders would have us believe, investors are in a buoyant mood, confident in their leaders’ stewardship of the global economy?
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent London bombings, that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems?
The role of phenomenally low long-term (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise.
Similarly, Latin America has been booming in recent years, despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform.
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region’s debts manageable, while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region’s commodity exports.
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe.
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical, just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook. As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
To be sure, emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree, rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets, but nobody expects this to go on forever.
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters, has declared the current situation “a conundrum.”
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out, with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world, raising growth rates everywhere.
Ordinarily, rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates – that is, unless, deep down, people have become nervous.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950’s and early 1960’s, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Since that was a golden era for global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that the 1950’s and 1960’s were also a period of massive insecurity.
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III – and with good reason, according to many historians.
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today’s record-low interest rates, then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation.
Investors’ collective psychology is notoriously fragile.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called “war on terror,” the notion of a “clash of civilization” between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict “within” a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the “Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a “clash of civilizations,” we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual’s identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples’ daily lives.
In some ways, “they” are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, “we” are afraid that “they” could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege – and, paradoxically, the virtue – of ignorance.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.
The End of the Russia-China Debate
Was it preferable to start with economics – try and get rich, quick, but don’t rock the boat politically – in the manner of the Chinese?
Or was it better to start with politics – recover liberty and prosperity may follow – which seemed to be Russia’s path under Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin?
This time the subject is no longer Russia versus China, because Russia has long ceased to be a point of comparison.
Instead, the new comparative debate involves Asia’s two new economic, demographic, and political giants, China and India.
In the “flat world” of globalization – to borrow Thomas Friedman’s powerful metaphor – it seems that Russia no longer has a place.
Of course, Russia is still the second-largest nuclear power in the world, and, as one of the world’s leading exporters of oil and gas, it benefits from today’s high energy prices.
To put it bluntly, Russia is no longer in the same category as China.
Whereas the “Middle Kingdom” is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline, Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status, but in a manner that appears doomed to fail.
Russia has clearly taken giant steps in the wrong direction, at a time when China has taken steps, however small, in the right direction.
When you meet today’s “new Russian Nomenklatura,” you experience a sudden feeling of being 20 years younger, awash as they are in nostalgia for Cold War posturing.
By contrast, seen from afar, in their new suits, you might think that Chinese economic elites are Japanese.
Where Russia represents a return to the past, one sees in China an opening, however ambiguous, to the future.
As a European, I and people like me almost instinctively expect more from Russia.
It is, after all, a European nation in cultural, if not political terms, whereas progress in China will not be measured by the introduction of Western-style democracy, but eventually, one hopes, by Singapore-style rule of law.
China and Russia tend to relate to their respective pasts and futures in very different ways – with self-confidence in China’s case, with self-diffidence in the case of Russia.
Chinese elites are convinced that time is working in their favor, and that it is only natural that China should regain its rank amongst the world leading powers, perhaps even emerging on top one day.
Indeed, their serene patience stands in stark contrast to the anxious reticence of Russian leaders, who have yet to surmount the humiliation that Russia suffered as a result of the Soviet Union’s disintegration at the end of the Cold War.
Russia may be experiencing a global “restoration” phase, but in politics and economics, and also with respect to its empire, restoration is headed in the wrong direction.
With Putin’s current clampdown on civil society, re-nationalization of key segments of the economy, failure to develop any political approach to resolving the conflict in Chechnya, and cultivation of imperial nostalgia, Russia is killing its only chance to matter in the future.
One senses in China the birth pangs of civil society, making the introduction of the rule of law increasingly urgent.
The Ethics of Eating
Yet in Europe and North America, there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced.
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called “white” – actually pale pink – veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.
In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef’s image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism, it is not yet a mainstream position.
When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment.
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.
The animals burn up most of that food’s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we end up with a small fraction – usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth – of the food value that we feed them.
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes.
The European Museum
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
Now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically, as Asia’s economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence.
Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate.
A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific.
In May 1968, in France, the students – or some of them, at least – who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao’s crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent.
Yesterday China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries – the defenders of the status quo in Europe.
The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don’t want to become like Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hard-won social guarantees.
Quality, costs, and delivery times in auto manufacturing, for example, are reaching the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging world-class companies, particularly in India, are increasingly able to recruit M.I.T. and Harvard graduates, while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms.
In fact, it would be fair to say that European politicians, with few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia.
But if Europe’s performance continues to decline, would this perception survive?
The Hamas Earthquake
Hamas’s crushing defeat of Fatah in this week’s elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads.
An Islamist political party that previously abstained from national politics and rejects Fatah’s policy of negotiations with Israel, is now in charge in Palestine.
Overall, that’s 60% of the seats in Parliament, won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza.
For their part, Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamas-led government.
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition, Fatah’s humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner.
So far, Fatah’s senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament, leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas.
Instead, they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah.
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners.
The political, security, and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems, not ideological purity.
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society.
Murder, kidnapping, and extortion have reached record heights.
In opposition, Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons.
Now, it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth, with poverty rates reaching 70% and unemployment at 35% .
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge, and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration.
More than anything else, Hamas’s success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues.
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence, and deliver services fairly and efficiently?
How will its election affect Palestine’s foreign aid inflows, which form major component of the national budget?
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe.
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government, because Hamas remains committed to Israel’s destruction.
Interestingly, however, Hamas’s election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state.
On the one hand, Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now.
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and, as a governing authority, will have to deal with the international response to its victory.
Immediately after the election, a senior Hamas official, Mahmoud al-Zahar, said that Hamas would maintain the cease-fire with Israel begun last February, if Israel did the same.
Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel.
In any case, despite the election results, and even without Fatah in government, Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel.
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks, although Israel, like the US, has refused to deal with Hamas.
They elected a party which called for “reform and change” in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness.
Victory achieved, Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
With the Palestinians’ future at stake – not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East – no one can say if Hamas is up to the task.
The Limits of Democracy
One remembers Hitler, who, while his own party did not quite get 50% of the vote, could base his “seizure of power” on a parliamentary majority.
More recently, elections in the post-communist countries of Europe have brought groups to power whose democratic credentials are dubious, to say the least.
This is not to compare Hamas to any of these political forces.
Nevertheless, one must wonder about a winning movement with quite a few elected members in Israeli prisons and others who are not likely to get permission to enter the country in which they were elected, so that the new parliament cannot function properly.
All of this tells us three things about democracy.
To be effective, elections must be preceded by an extensive period of debate and argument.
First elections, in particular, are almost inevitably of limited value as foundations of democracy, because they take place in an emotionally charged atmosphere and largely without substantive debate.
They are an invitation to assert who one is and where one belongs rather than to a competition of well-defined and comprehensive political programs.
This means, secondly, that first elections, and perhaps elections more generally, are not themselves a sufficient guarantee of liberty.
As the German constitutional court judge Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde famously put it, democracies cannot create the conditions of their survival and success.
The answer to the first question is, the rule of law.
There must be certain accepted rules of the political game that are binding on all, so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified.
This is what happened in Iraq, for example.
But the constitutional convention, too, must be elected, and this election may run into the very difficulties that plague first elections to parliaments in new democracies.
In sovereign states and territories, this is highly unlikely to come about on its own.
Some say that it is achieved only once a country has passed the “two-turnover test,” that is, two changes of government without violence.
One must add to this criterion a culture of debate that makes elections a genuine contest of a plurality of answers to the issues at stake.
The Media War on Terror
“More than half of this battle is taking place on the battlefield of the media, [for] we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of [Muslims].”
The speaker was not some public relations executive, but Osama bin Laden’s chief lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Terrorists have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in today’s media age, but, for the most part, America and the governments of the other democracies have not.
Consider that the violent extremists have their own “media relations committees” aimed at manipulating elite opinion.
They know that communications transcend borders, and that a single news story, handled skillfully, can be as damaging to our cause – and as helpful to theirs – as any military attack.
And they are able to act quickly with relatively few people, and with modest resources compared to the vast, expensive bureaucracies of democratic governments.
In Tunisia, the largest newspaper has a circulation of roughly 50,000 in a country of 10 million people.
A few years ago, under Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi could have his tongue cut out if he was found in possession of a satellite dish or used the Internet without government approval.
Today, satellite dishes are ubiquitous in Iraq as well.
Media outlets in many parts of the world often serve only to inflame and distort – rather than to explain and inform.
While al-Qaeda and extremist movements have used this forum for many years, further poisoning the Muslim public’s view of the West, we in the West have barely even begun to compete.
First published in a weekly news magazine, the story was then posted on Web sites, sent in e-mails, and repeated on satellite television and radio stations for days before the facts could be discovered.
That false story incited deadly anti-American riots in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The United States military, appropriately and of necessity, took the time needed to ensure that it had the facts before responding that the charges were untrue.
In the meantime, innocent lives were lost.
The resulting explosion of critical press stories then causes everything – all activity, all initiative – to stop.
This leads to a “chilling effect” among those serving in the military public affairs field, who conclude that there is no tolerance for innovation.
Consider for a moment the vast quantity of column inches and hours of television devoted to the allegations of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib.
Compare that to the volume of coverage and condemnation associated with, say, the discovery of Saddam Hussein’s mass graves, which were filled with hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis.
Free governments must make communications planning a central component of every aspect of this struggle.
Indeed, the longer it takes to put a strategic communications framework into place, the more the vacuum will be filled by the enemy.
They worked to help focus media attention on America’s commitment to help the Pakistani people.
Public opinion surveys conducted by private groups before and after the earthquake suggest that attitudes in Pakistan regarding the US changed dramatically because of this new awareness.
Government public affairs and public diplomacy efforts are slowly beginning to reorient staffing, schedules, and bureaucratic culture to engage the full range of today’s media.
That requires instituting 24-hour press operations centers and elevating Internet operations and other channels to the status of traditional twentieth-century press relations.
It will require less reliance on the traditional print media, just as the publics of the US and the world are relying less on newspapers.
During the Cold War, institutions such as Radio Free Europe proved to be valuable instruments.
It is a test of wills and it will be won or lost in the court of global public opinion.
While the enemy is skillful at manipulating the media and using the tools of communications to their advantage, we have an advantage as well: truth is on our side, and, ultimately, truth wins out.
The Nation State Revisited
Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
Indeed, on closer inspection, it proves to be dubious, when not simply wrong.
The nation state, with both its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well.
The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful, and entirely absent in the case of the UN and other world institutions.
Moreover, despite the frequent search for new identities, European or Latin American or otherwise, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a “world civil society,” most people feel at home in their own country – the nation state of which they are citizens.
What does it take to be British or German or American?
Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations.
The nation state has been, and continues to be, the relevant unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings for more than two centuries.
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or inward-looking.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
France, Spain, and Poland have attempted to keep major industries firmly in “national hands.”
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to fragmented markets is taking root.
Although freedom of movement for labor is one of the single market’s “four freedoms,” many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to economic conflict, which can rapidly turn into more serious clashes.
Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel – clearly a pro-European – went to the meeting with the explicit intention of barring the creation of other European powers in this field.
The German-Russian agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder leading the effort, has already harmed Polish-German relations, to say nothing of European cooperation.
This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate – indeed, dangerous – if the pendulum now swung back to old-fashioned nationalism.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
The Politics of Frustration
Does extreme poverty breed violence and ultimately revolution?
Many people believe that it does, and seek to explain phenomena ranging from guerrilla insurgencies to Islamist terrorism accordingly.
Extreme poverty breeds apathy, not rebellion.
A far more critical group in any society are those who have begun to move forward to new conditions, but then find their path blocked.
Their desires and ambitions are not unrealistic in the circumstances, but they are frustrated.
This group, not the desperately poor and helpless, forms the great mobilizing force of violent protest, and ultimately of major change.
The politics of frustration has been particularly apparent in the postcommunist world during the last fifteen years.
The heavy hand of nomenklatura rule was gone, and the vision of a new life like that in the open societies of the West seemed real.
Those who had the chance migrated, first to their homeland’s centers of economic progress, then abroad, to countries and places where the new world could be found immediately.
It made the valley of tears bearable both by offering financial and other assistance and by holding out the promise of membership and economic prosperity in the near future.
With the onset of modernization, millions of people were uprooted from their traditional communities and ways of life.
Young men, in particular, saw the prospect of a life more like that presented to them by Western television.
But they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated.
In fact, it would take at least a generation, during which much of the effort of modern life would have to be made, while the fruits of this effort would remain elusive.
If the benefits do not come quickly – and for most people they do not – they get restless.
For them, the old world of traditional ties and customs is gone, but the new world of modernity remains out of reach.
Seductive leaders (Hitler among them) exploited the resulting sense of frustration.
What we call “terrorism” has many causes, and one must beware of facile explanations.
However, the politics of frustration, of ambitions raised and then thwarted, is clearly one such cause.
It is thus also a challenge to those of us living in more fortunate circumstances.
If we do not wish to be submerged in violence and authoritarian responses to it, international institutions must do for the modernizing world what the EU has managed to do for the postcommunist countries.
The Promise of Iraq’s Constitution
The constitutional process now under way in Iraq represents a hopeful milestone for all Iraqis.
After decades of successively imposed constitutions, an elected assembly has overseen the process of drafting a new permanent constitution, and the draft text will be voted on by ordinary Iraqis on October 15.
Much of the current talk about the draft’s various provisions thus misses the point.
Regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails, and regardless of the details of the constitutional text, what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq, before and after the referendum.
Concerning the pre-referendum phase, the National Assembly largely succeeded in this task.
Although Iraq’s interim constitution gave the Assembly exclusive control over the drafting process, the Assembly wisely reached out beyond its membership in creating a constitutional drafting committee.
Iraqi leaders were well aware of the decreased participation in the election by a significant portion of Iraq’s multi-ethnic and multi-confessional mosaic, particularly the Sunni community.
Accordingly, they sought out those who were under-represented in the Assembly, but whose sense of participation in and ownership of the process was essential, not merely to the constitutional exercise, but to binding the nation’s wounds.
Reaching out was an important component of establishing the rule of law, and it also sent a message that Iraq had truly turned a corner – that no single party sought to dominate Iraq.
This was an important signal that those elected to the National Assembly understood that democracy does not mean merely the will of the majority.
In the end, Iraq’s voters will decide whether this is a constitution under which they wish to be governed for the foreseeable future.
A second important feature of the drafting process was the extent to which the National Assembly complied with the requirements of Iraq’s interim constitution, the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL).
At the time of the transfer of authority in June of 2004, many pundits predicted that an elected National Assembly would ignore an interim constitution drafted by an unelected Governing Council and promulgated by an occupying authority.
The TAL set a rigorous schedule for the Assembly to complete an initial constitutional draft, and the Assembly essentially abided by those limits. The deadline extension that it passed was in keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the TAL.
The test for institution building, however, will come once a constitution has been approved and a new government installed.
Regardless of who wins the elections, there will be temptations to tinker with the constitutional text.
Barring some compelling need, the calculus might well arise that it is more important to abide by the constitution for some time – and to be seen to be abiding by it – than it is even to improve its provisions.
The American administration was absolutely right to resist the call to turn Iraq over to a caudillo, as some wanted.
Here again, Iraq’s immediate past history allows one to be optimistic.
The Iraqi Governing Council was not dominated by any single member, and Iraq’s subsequent governments have also operated collegially.
Giving life to constitutionally defined political institutions is far more important to the course of Iraq’s immediate future than the specific provisions that the constitution contains.
That has been the missing ingredient, not only in Iraq, but also in other countries ruled by despots.
Constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals, and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights.
The question is whether those guarantees are given meaning on the ground.
The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance
The rejection of the European Union’s Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters was, according to all evidence, more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of Europe.
The general instability of social relations – most importantly, but not only, of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries, not just in Europe.
Capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation: social security, which served as a principal stabilizer, at least in the developed countries; Keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption, without which the genius of capitalism – mass production – does not work.
Employment is increasingly precariousness.
And where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity, it has become impossible to suppress.
It is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said “no” two months ago.
After all, beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system, the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system’s inherent instability.
Consider the simple fact that the American economy is now more than $600 billion in debt.
The United States cannot function without being able to borrow $1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year, mainly from the emerging economies of Asia, and China above all.
But this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low, if the price of oil rises too high, or if the American economy backfires.
In fact, the US economy has become increasingly detached from reality.
Meanwhile, two speculative bubbles – in the real estate market and in mortgages – have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US.
A crash, or at least a sharp spasm, is quite likely in the near future, and the consequences – for America and the world – may be catastrophic.
This instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system.
Sovereign debt, needed by all countries, but particularly by the poorest, suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements.
To make matters worse, national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation.
Of course – indeed, above all – in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance.
With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices, the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda.
A new Bretton Woods could not be more urgent!
The Trade-and-Aid Myth
More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries’ markets for poor countries’ products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda.
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but howmuch to do, and how fast.
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains.
This one faces a trade embargo in the world’s largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank.
As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis).
By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that.
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO.
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico’s economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms.
Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then.
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell.
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country’s economic fortunes.
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso’s exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy.
With none of Mexico’s advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers.
South Korea took off in the early 1960’s not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out.
It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.
Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets.
The word “diamond” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius.
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators – for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign.
It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North.
Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries.
Today’s Counter-Enlightenment
A process that had begun with the Enlightenment had now reached the point at which “anything goes.”
Particularly in the arts, there were no apparent limits to showing what even a generation ago would have been regarded as highly offensive.
Two generations ago, most countries had censors who not only tried to prevent younger people from seeing certain films but who actually banned books.
Since the 1960’s, such proscriptions have weakened until, in the end, explicit sexuality, violence, blasphemy – while upsetting to some people – were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world.
The denial of a well-documented truth may lead to new crimes.
But is the answer to the old question, “What is truth?” always so clear?
What exactly are we doing if we insist on Turkey’s acknowledgement that the Armenian genocide did take place as a condition of its membership in the European Union?
Are we so sure of Darwin’s theories of evolution that we should ban alternative notions of genesis from schools?
One such limit is the incitement to violence.
The man who gets up in a crowded theater and shouts, “Fire!” when there is none is guilty of what happens in the resulting stampede.
This is the context in which we may see the invasion of Islamic taboos into the enlightened, mostly non-Islamic world.
From the fatwa on Salman Rushdie for The Satanic Verses to the killing of a nun in Somalia in response to Pope Benedict’s Regensburg lecture and the Berlin Opera’s cancellation of a performance of Mozart’s Idomeneo , with its severed heads of religious founders, including Muhammad, we have seen violence and intimidation used to defend a particular religion’s taboos.
This means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not.
If anyone does not like them, there are all the instruments of public debate and of critical discourse that an enlightened community has at its disposal.
The kind of reaction we have seen recently to expressions of views that are offensive to some does not bode well for the future of liberty.
It is as if a new wave of counter-enlightenment is sweeping the world, with the most restrictive views dominating the scene.
Whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad (or Christ, for that matter) is a matter of judgment, almost of taste.
I might not do it, but I would nevertheless defend the right of someone who decides otherwise.
Why Pay More for Fairness?
In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers.
For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall.
Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers’ associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor.
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “well-meaning dead end.”
With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.
In Lindsey’s view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices.
If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that’s what James Bond prefers, economists don’t object that the market is being distorted.
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.
If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.
