Another idea is to require anyone in the US wanting to regularize their immigration status to go home and wait in line there.
Specter’s proposal also provides for reinforced security at the border, as well as a six-year non-renewable Temporary Workers Program without a path to residency, although it would allow unauthorized immigrants to remain in the US with a new, non-immigrant status.
There was a time when north-south migratory flows in the western hemisphere were limited to Mexico and the Caribbean.
If the perception of further US hostility toward Latin America persists, the tilt toward an irresponsible, demagogic left will harden.
Particularly the losers, often represented by young men with no future to look forward to, can be induced to take even suicidal action against the alleged enemy.
Perhaps one should not be surprised that at such a time, the oldest of our ugly ­– indeed, deadly – resentments, anti-Semitism, is re-emerging from the shadows.
But no one knows whether China’s baby step is the start of something much bigger, as China’s authorities hint one day and deny the next.
Last but not least, the Chinese authorities desperately need to maintain the country’s breakneck economic growth in order to preserve the Communist Party’s legitimacy. But, as the economy becomes richer and more complex, there will be no escaping the market imperative in internal credit allocation.
But China’s current situation is vastly different.
Equally important, unlike other East Asian economies during their early take-off stages, the expansion of China’s export sector in the last decade has not been closely linked to the development of its domestic non-trade sector, because the expansion has been fueled mainly by foreign direct investment (FDI).
Indeed, if foreign-owned enterprises exports are deducted from the total trade volume, the surplus vanishes, because both the overall balance of merchandise trade and the balance of trade in services normally run deficits.
With its huge domestic economy, China would never have been able to accumulate such an enormous external surplus if its growth had not been confined to such enterprises.
The US administration is determined to consolidate political freedoms in many developing countries under its sphere of influence; indeed, expansion of democracy has become a cornerstone of American foreign policy.
Empirical evidence supports the idea that the success of a democracy depends on the openness of the underlying economic system at the time of political transition.
Conversely, when democratic transition was attempted in a fragile and closed economic environment, the outcome was much worse.
But when it comes to economic development, these fundamental rights are more important than other purely political aspects of democracy, such as universal suffrage and genuine political competition.
Allowing free elections and true political competition is also critically important, but this should follow economic reforms, not precede them.
The target of the attack, Al Qaeda’s number two man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was not among the dead, although lesser figures in the terrorist organization reportedly were.
Indeed, it would be hard for the current administration to say that it wouldn’t do the same thing again, because it has done it many times before.
This consistent pattern of readiness to inflict civilian casualties – often when striking targets that are not of vital military significance – suggests that Bush and other pro-life American leaders have less concern for the lives of innocent human beings in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, than they have for human embryos.
This is a bizarre set of priorities.
The important question now is whether today’s high asset prices are the result of some such fundamental development, or whether bubbles have formed.
It is, of course, true that real long-term interest rates have declined quite markedly – not suddenly and not only recently, but at a fairly steady pace for more than twenty years.
But, while the worldwide recession of 1981-2 brought inflation down rapidly, nominal long-term interest rates did not fall immediately, for the world’s markets were still not convinced.
Whatever their other benefits, the low rates we see around the world now hardly amount to insurance against future drops in asset prices.
The first feature of the liberal order is that democracies must not tolerate those who set out to destroy democracy.
Some countries, like Germany, have laws that make it possible to ban political parties whose programs are recognizably anti-democratic.
A vibrant civil society will mobilize when the rule of law is violated, and it can also check the illiberal inclinations of democratic majorities.
The near-universal availability of information makes it much easier than it was in earlier times for the voluntary non-governmental organizations that form civil society to emerge.
The first Christian evangelization trips of Saint Peter and Saint Paul were to Turkey.
Later, Ottoman Turkey was for centuries considered a part of the “concert of Europe,” proving indispensable in defining and securing the strategic balance among the European continent’s Great Powers.
And yet Turkey scares countless Europeans.
By contrast, Turkey’s large, secular intellectual community, whose cultural background is European, and from which the Turkish state recruits most of its executives, has remained in Istanbul and Ankara.
As the watchdog organization Transparency International reminds us, corruption exposed is in many cases corruption prevented.
Direct incitement to violence is regarded – as it should be ­– as an unacceptable abuse of free speech; but much that is disagreeable about the David Irving’s and the hate preachers does not fall into this category.
With their enormous cash flow, Russian billionaires are buying sumptuous properties all over the world, and Russia is buying prominent Germans like the former Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, if not the support of Germany as such.
Whatever the enormous differences that may separate them, post-communist Russia and fundamentalist Iran have much in common.
Energy wealth gives them a sense of unique opportunity, the conviction that time is playing in their favor, and that they can now redress the humiliations they have suffered from the outside world.
He does not match Peter the Great in physical stature, but he has proven to be a gifted politician, capable of grasping, then controlling, the mood of the Russian people.
Nor can the Putin regime’s manipulation of popular xenophobia against citizens of the former Soviet empire, such as Georgians.
Perhaps what it requires most is a touch of Margaret Thatcher’s policies of the 1980’s, combined with Tony Blair’s rhetoric of today.
Iran’s Political Clerics
Its standoff with the West over its nuclear program, together with its ties to Syria and its growing influence in Lebanon and Iraq, suggest the emergence of a strong regional power.
But, while Western analysts and Iran’s neighbors raise the alarm, the regime’s authority is in fact built on insecure foundations.
The 1979 revolution, which ended Iran’s monarchical tradition, created a new political order based on Shiite theological foundations and giving absolute ruling power to a Shiite jurist/cleric.
Throughout Iran’s long history, Shiite seminaries exercised great influence on Iranian society and politics, but they had been considered civil institutions.
As a result, religious interpretation – previously, a highly decentralized function undertaken by various seminaries – was concentrated in the hands of a political leader.
Accordingly, the seminary establishment was no longer a civil structure managing only religious affairs, but instead developed into a unified, ideological party serving the interests of the regime.
The concept of a decentralized religious establishment is difficult for Westerners to understand, given the highly structured administrative framework of Christian churches and ecclesiastical orders.
But this fluid hierarchy, an absence of written rules and organizational order, allowed the various seminaries – and their different interpretive traditions – to survive despotic political regimes and resist intervention by different dynasties and monarchies.
Since Shiite fundamentalism is itself a recent phenomenon, the early Iranian revolutionaries inevitably rebuilt the religious seminaries along lines suggested by the Iranian opposition’s most powerful pre-revolutionary discourse: communist ideology.
By “modernizing” the seminaries following a single-party model, the revolutionaries gained control over them.
Iran’s current supreme ruler, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, whose religious degree was a focus of suspicion in the seminary and among the clerical elite, was not considered a jurist by merit.
Consequently, Khamenei’s evident lack of religious legitimacy has pushed the government to assume full control over the clerical establishment, further depriving the seminaries of their historical independence.
The last decades have provided the regime with near-ideal conditions to seize control over the Shiite clerical establishment in Iraq as well.
Under Saddam Hussein, restrictions were imposed on the Shiite seminary in Najaf – traditionally a counterbalance to Iran’s Shiite establishment – forcing the emigration of a number of clerics to the Iranian seminary in Qom.
It was also strengthened by the regime’s activities in the 1980’s, when it created Hezbollah as a guerilla organization in Lebanon, thereby expanding its domination over the most important Shiite areas in the region.
The Iranian regime then consolidated its mastery of the Shiite network in the Middle East, and now uses this control to further its own interests.
Khamenei, the supreme leader, has succeeded in politicizing the Shiite clerical establishment, primarily by controlling the financial resources of the religious authorities and Shiite institutions in Iran and the region.
Iraq’s leading Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, has not been able to act independently and has avoided opposing Iranian policies toward Iraq in order to protect his fragile network of institutions.
With the seminaries politicized and their independence greatly reduced, the religious establishment is no longer in a position to confer political legitimacy on the regime.
Nor can it exercise its traditional functions in the religious sphere to provide support to civil society in the country.
At a time when the Islamic Republic has failed in its economic and political promises to the Iranian people, the regime’s most glaring weakness may prove to be the absence of a credible religious authority that can justify its shortcomings.
In the early 1970’s, when it was still an overwhelmingly agrarian country and Islamization was just gaining momentum, Malaysia embarked on its so-called “New Economic Policy” (NEP), designed to help the majority Malays gain a bigger share of the country’s wealth.
His choice of Abdullah Badawi, the current prime minister, helped UMNO regain the Islamist moral high ground that the PAS had been claiming.
By the time the last child whispers the information to the first, it is totally different from what was originally said.
The belief that the other’s religion is not Islam, and its followers not Muslim, has underpinned internecine wars in which millions have died – and continue to die.
Then there are other divisions, including the Druze, the Alawites, and the Wahabis.
The result was intellectual regression at the very moment that Europe began embracing scientific and mathematical knowledge.
A quick survey of the history of religious conflict shows that theological controversies have never been resolved by theological arguments.
Instead of fighting on behalf of political and religious liberty, we risk engaging in a conflict with the false images that the terrorists have created.
Worse still, we would bring this conflict into our own societies, where different religious and cultural traditions are now inextricably mingled.
In the end, while a loose opposition coalition of pro-reform ex-MP’s, Islamists, and liberals gained a majority of the National Assembly’s 50 seats, no woman won.
Islamist candidates were in an awkward position, seeking support from women voters, whose participation they opposed.
With pro-reform forces strengthening their position in the new parliament, the government has two choices.
Traditionally, the role of ruling Emir alternated (according to a tacit agreement) between two rival branches of the Al Sabah family – the Al Jaber and the Al Salem.
According to Kuwait’s constitution, the new ruler has one year to appoint a crown prince, but he has to appoint a prime minister immediately.
The victory of Parliament in Kuwait’s succession crisis is likely to lead some of Kuwait’s neighboring autocracies to stiffen their resolve against modernity and democracy.
As a result, they took care to frame their demands in ways that provided a measure of Islamic identity.
This threatened the authority of the King, who had overseen the religious establishment, as well as feminists’ efforts to moderate Morocco’s Family Law, which had been based on a rigid view of religious teachings.
They challenged the disparities in legal treatment of women, broached new ideas concerning the role of women in Moroccan society, and questioned practices that had long been understood as Islamic.
Over the past decade, the number of Moroccan women taking an active role in Islamist associations or political parties increased dramatically.
For many women, however, the veil is a token of liberation – an indication that they have engaged with the Moroccan public in ways that reflect their own sense of religious practice.
This Parliament enacted a new Family Law in 2004 that mandates full equality between men and women as “head of household,” full authority for state courts in matters of divorce, creation of special family courts, and the possibility of maternal custody in the event of divorce.
Feminist interpretations of religious texts – encouraged by increasing numbers of women in prominent religious positions – continue to challenge traditionalists of all stripes.
This dynamism could lead to instability, owing to multiple sources of mistrust and the lack of strong regional institutions to help manage rivalries.
Not infrequently they have to form a “grand coalition.”
The rest of the vote is split many ways – unless a political force emerges to cut right through the old party structures by arousing popular nationalist or socialist sentiments, or a combination of the two.
Once in power, they simply make for bad government.
Taking two recent European examples, Poles and Slovaks will likely soon realize that their new populist governments do more harm than good to the people and their country.
Putting Lebanon Together
Today’s crisis in Lebanon is a crisis of the Lebanese state.
It is this structural crisis that must be addressed if the violence is to stop.
When Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon in 2000, the international understanding was that the Lebanese government would re-assert its authority in the evacuated area.
Hezbollah, which led the armed struggle against Israeli occupation, was to disarm and re-invent itself as a political force, representing the Shiite community that was historically marginalized by Lebanon’s ruling Maronite, Sunni, and Druze elites.
Instead of deploying its forces in southern Lebanon, the weak government in Beirut acquiesced in Hezbollah’s determination to turn the area into a staging ground for attacks against Israel.
Over the last six years, Hezbollah established a virtual state-within-a-state: its militia became the only military force in southern Lebanon, setting up outposts along the frontier with Israel, sometimes only a few meters away from the border.
UN Security Council resolution 1559, which explicitly called for the disarming of all militias and the reassertion of Lebanese government authority in the south, went unheeded.
After the much-heralded “Cedar Revolution” of 2005, Hezbollah even joined the Lebanese government, while at the same time maintaining its armed militia and control of the south.
Israel, for its part, still reeling from the trauma of its ill-begotten war in Lebanon in 1982, chose not to respond to Hezbollah’s attacks and hoped that the attacks would not escalate.
Yet such absurd situations tend to explode, as occurred with Hezbollah’s abduction of two Israeli soldiers within Israeli territory.
Yet Lebanon itself is too weak to assert its sovereignty.
On the other hand, Israel will not allow Hezbollah to re-establish itself along its border, or to maintain its missile capability.
To achieve any reassertion of effective Lebanese sovereignty in southern Lebanon, a robust international effort is needed, beyond the current hand wringing and rhetoric.
The main elements of such an international solution are the following:
The existing UN force in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, is a sad joke.
Like the UN presence in Srebrenica during the Bosnian war, UNIFIL has given the UN a bad name: it never stopped terrorists from attacking Israel, nor did it stop the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
It could be based on NATO capabilities, with a strong European ingredient.
To add legitimacy for its delicate mission within an Arab country, soldiers from Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and perhaps Pakistan, should be added.
The mission of such a force should be to help deploy – by force, if necessary – the Lebanese Army in southern Lebanon, to participate in disarming Hezbollah, and to patrol the Israeli-Lebanese border, ensuring that no incursions take place from either side.
Last but not least: it is not widely known that one anomaly of Lebanon’s status until this very day is that Syria has not fully recognized its existence as a sovereign nation (in Syrian school textbooks, Lebanon figures as part of Greater Syria).
Consequently, there are no normal diplomatic relations between the two countries – no Syrian embassy in Beirut and no Lebanese embassy in Damascus.
This is absurd and dangerous, and the hapless Arab League has never truly addressed it.
To bolster Lebanese independence and security, and in line with UN resolution 1559, which brought about the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, Syria should be pushed to recognize Lebanon’s sovereignty and independence.
Lebanon itself cannot establish its sovereignty in the country’s south, and Israeli military force is incapable of doing it.
Empty words from St. Petersburg, Brussels, or UN headquarters will not suffice, nor will a mere ceasefire, as that would simply return the area to square one.
Only an effective military force, with international legitimacy, can supply it.
Otherwise, we are all condemned to the continuation of the present cycles of violence.
The world’s 190-plus states now co-exist with a larger number of powerful non-sovereign and at least partly (and often largely) independent actors, ranging from corporations to non-government organizations (NGO’s), from terrorist groups to drug cartels, from regional and global institutions to banks and private equity funds.
What is needed now is a successor arrangement in which a larger number of governments, including the United States, China, and India, accept emissions limits or adopt common standards because they recognize that they would be worse off if no country did.
Similarly, America’s preventive war against an Iraq that ignored the UN and was thought to possess weapons of mass destruction showed that sovereignty no longer provides absolute protection.
The diplomatic challenge for this era is to gain widespread support for principles of state conduct and a procedure for determining remedies when these principles are violated.
But the concept needs to be adapted to a world in which the main challenges to order come from what global forces do to states and what governments do to their citizens rather than from what states do to one another.
Decisions made in Moscow can affect world energy prices, the future of the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, and the success of terrorists.
In order to remain intact and functional, the country needs a political system and a society that persuade talented young people to stay in Russia – and that provides them with the education to develop their talent.
The challenge for Russia’s leaders is to use its oil wealth to educate Russia’s people and rebuild Russia’s infrastructure, thereby ensuring global competitiveness and employment growth.
Russia should be treated as a major power, which means consultations on important global issues.
The opposite is true of Mittal, where the Lakshmi Mittal and his family own more than 60% of the shares.
If it is led into a more adventurous strategy, its sustained policy of research and heavy investment in up-market steel products may be weakened.
Where are our societies headed if company owners consider that quality is too expensive and that workers must be made insecure in order to make them less demanding?
If the boundaries between nuclear haves and have-nots becomes more permeable, or even dissolves altogether, the entire multilateral security system could be called into question.
Indeed, it looks like that is what will be needed.
China, humiliated by Kim Jong Il, will for the first time have to assume leadership in the region and resolve, or at least contain, the crisis.
Should the US be tempted now, in response to the failure of its policy, to consider a military “option” against Iran, the nuclearization of the international system will not be arrested.
The Chávez Challenge
President Hugo Chávez showed once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation’s poor and desperate, and that he is miles ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill, cunning, and ruthlessness.
Yet at the same time voter turnout is declining with each passing election under Chávez, and the questionable fairness of the electoral process has grown increasingly apparent.
To be sure, the opposition’s withdrawal from the election just days before the vote was, as Chávez claimed, more a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process.
And, just as surely, that very weakness is a function of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela’s traditional democratic order.
Even so, the opposition’s mistakes have been massive, ranging from support for the failed coup against the democratically elected Chávez in April 2002 to the failed strike at PEDEVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company, in early 2003.
Nothing is more lethal in politics than failure in direct confrontation.
In such circumstances, Chávez can afford to be bold, despite his policies’ failure to benefit his core constituency: the more than 50% of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair.
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood “barefoot doctor” services, the overall welfare of the poor remains the same, if not worse.
Chávez will be able to modify the Constitution largely as he pleases, and pack both the justice system and the electoral authority with his placemen.
He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.
Yet, if this is what the Venezuelan people want, then so be it.
It is, after all, their business who governs them, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated, democratic institutions are not indefinitely suspended, and standard norms of international conduct are respects.
For years, he has been accused of taking over where Fidel Castro left off: supporting the rhetoric of radicalism and anti-imperialism, if not revolution, throughout Latin America.
It could now be time for other Latin American nations and the international community to take such charges more seriously.
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner’s political fortunes.
In Mar del Plata, Argentina, last month, he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), in the company of, among others, Evo Morales, the coca-leaf growers’ leader from Bolivia who might well become that country’s next president.
Similarly, Chávez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega, the perennial Sandinista presidential candidate in Nicaragua, and Shafick Handal, the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador.
His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in campaign events for Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador’s presidential campaign.
There seems to be a common thread to most of Chávez’s foreign policy: to provoke a major confrontation with the United States.
The danger, of course, is that if and when confrontation comes – over Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights, or press freedoms – it will be too late to defuse it.
The hemisphere’s other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests.
Although many of Chávez’s positions have found support in certain Latin American nations, the division that he and Castro’s Cuba have created in Latin America – between left and right, free-traders and “Bolivarians,” and pro- and anti- Americans – is mainly artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome.
The last time revolutionary leaders confronted the US head-on, in Central America during the 1980’s, everyone lost.
A new split up and down the hemisphere, engineered by a leader awash in oil money, would prove far more disastrous.
The level of entrepreneurial activity in the country as a whole doubled as a result, but the response was very different from one municipality to another.
In her book Money, Morals & Manners, the sociologist Michèle Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States.
She concluded that, “In many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers (as the residents of the US mid-Western state of Indiana are called) than to the Parisians.”
King Fahad, the longest-serving king in Saudi Arabia’s history (24 years), is dead.
The reformers talk about partial municipal elections, national dialogue, and the rights of women, who they hint may one day even be allowed to drive cars!
Both are insufficient to check Naif.
Now that King Fahad is gone, old scores among his numerous brothers and half brothers, not to mention the thousands of princes in the next generation, will need to be settled.
The direction the country will take in the longer term can best be assessed by whom Abdullah chooses to name as the successor to Prince Sultan, Naif’s chief ally who has already been named Abdullah’s heir.
An indiscriminate attack such as a bomb in the Underground will necessarily hit people of many cultural backgrounds and beliefs.
Few thought it possible that they would turn against each other in a bloodletting of such brutal enormity that it is very unlikely that Bosnia-Herzegovina can ever become a successful multicultural society.
Beneath the veneer of integration into a multicultural environment, many people – especially young men with an immigrant background – are lost in the world of contradictions around them.
It is a far cry even from such doubtful claims as the self-determination of peoples defined as ethnic communities.
Hate preachers use highly modern methods to enhance their personal power and to create havoc around them.
Of course, part of the answer is to identify the relatively small number of people who are prepared to use their lives to destroy the lives of others without distinction or purpose.
But the more important issue is to identify the preachers of hate and stop their murderous incitement.
Beyond this carefully targeted – and, in principle, limited – task, there remains the need to strengthen the sphere of common values and cooperation in societies that will, after all, remain multicultural.
This will be difficult, and it must not be approached naively.
The Economy of Fear
Is it because, as G-8 leaders would have us believe, investors are in a buoyant mood, confident in their leaders’ stewardship of the global economy?
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent London bombings, that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems?
The role of phenomenally low long-term (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise.
Similarly, Latin America has been booming in recent years, despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform.
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region’s debts manageable, while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region’s commodity exports.
Ordinarily, a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations, followed by rising interest rates at all maturities. But this time, even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line, long-term interest rates – which are far more important – have been magically declining.
Indeed, America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment, with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style.
Homeowners, backed by rising house prices, are piling up debt.
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe.
Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more, secure about their long-term future, either because of fears about terrorism, a global pandemic, or a severe rash of financial crises.
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical, just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook. As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
To be sure, emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree, rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets, but nobody expects this to go on forever.
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters, has declared the current situation “a conundrum.”
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out, with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world, raising growth rates everywhere.
Ordinarily, rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates – that is, unless, deep down, people have become nervous.
Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong, but that maybe – just maybe – things will fall apart. In this case, it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950’s and early 1960’s, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Since that was a golden era for global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that the 1950’s and 1960’s were also a period of massive insecurity.
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III – and with good reason, according to many historians.
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today’s record-low interest rates, then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation.
Investors’ collective psychology is notoriously fragile.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called “war on terror,” the notion of a “clash of civilization” between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict “within” a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the “Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a “clash of civilizations,” we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
There is a clash within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual’s identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples’ daily lives.
In some ways, “they” are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, “we” are afraid that “they” could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege – and, paradoxically, the virtue – of ignorance.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.
The End of the Russia-China Debate
Was it preferable to start with economics – try and get rich, quick, but don’t rock the boat politically – in the manner of the Chinese?
Or was it better to start with politics – recover liberty and prosperity may follow – which seemed to be Russia’s path under Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin?
This time the subject is no longer Russia versus China, because Russia has long ceased to be a point of comparison.
Instead, the new comparative debate involves Asia’s two new economic, demographic, and political giants, China and India.
In the “flat world” of globalization – to borrow Thomas Friedman’s powerful metaphor – it seems that Russia no longer has a place.
Of course, Russia is still the second-largest nuclear power in the world, and, as one of the world’s leading exporters of oil and gas, it benefits from today’s high energy prices.
To put it bluntly, Russia is no longer in the same category as China.
Whereas the “Middle Kingdom” is proudly regaining its former global status after centuries of decline, Russia is defiantly trying to resurrect its former imperial status, but in a manner that appears doomed to fail.
Russia has clearly taken giant steps in the wrong direction, at a time when China has taken steps, however small, in the right direction.
When you meet today’s “new Russian Nomenklatura,” you experience a sudden feeling of being 20 years younger, awash as they are in nostalgia for Cold War posturing.
By contrast, seen from afar, in their new suits, you might think that Chinese economic elites are Japanese.
Where Russia represents a return to the past, one sees in China an opening, however ambiguous, to the future.
As a European, I and people like me almost instinctively expect more from Russia.
It is, after all, a European nation in cultural, if not political terms, whereas progress in China will not be measured by the introduction of Western-style democracy, but eventually, one hopes, by Singapore-style rule of law.
The diverse paths followed by Russia and China may be explained in part by how the two peoples perceive themselves.
The Chinese are comforted in their self-image by the world’s combination of admiration for their dynamism, greed for the market they constitute, and apprehension for the competition they represent.
China and Russia tend to relate to their respective pasts and futures in very different ways – with self-confidence in China’s case, with self-diffidence in the case of Russia.
Chinese elites are convinced that time is working in their favor, and that it is only natural that China should regain its rank amongst the world leading powers, perhaps even emerging on top one day.
Indeed, their serene patience stands in stark contrast to the anxious reticence of Russian leaders, who have yet to surmount the humiliation that Russia suffered as a result of the Soviet Union’s disintegration at the end of the Cold War.
Russia may be experiencing a global “restoration” phase, but in politics and economics, and also with respect to its empire, restoration is headed in the wrong direction.
With Putin’s current clampdown on civil society, re-nationalization of key segments of the economy, failure to develop any political approach to resolving the conflict in Chechnya, and cultivation of imperial nostalgia, Russia is killing its only chance to matter in the future.
The gap between the respective qualities of China’s economic and scientific elites, on the one hand, and its ruling political elites, on the other, is simply too monumental – and still growing – for stability to be taken for granted.
One senses in China the birth pangs of civil society, making the introduction of the rule of law increasingly urgent.
The Ethics of Eating
Yet in Europe and North America, there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced.
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called “white” – actually pale pink – veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.
In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef’s image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.
Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans – eating no animal products at all.
Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism, it is not yet a mainstream position.
They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible, then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds.
Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings.
But there are usually at least four hens per cage, and often more.
When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment.
Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.
They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so that she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.
The animals burn up most of that food’s energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we end up with a small fraction – usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth – of the food value that we feed them.
By contrast, cows grazing on pasture eat food that we cannot digest, which means that they add to the amount of food available to us.
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes.
If this continues, the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale than now exists in the West, as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system.
The European Museum
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
Now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically, as Asia’s economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence.
Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate.
A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific.
In May 1968, in France, the students – or some of them, at least – who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.
Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao’s crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent.
Yesterday China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries – the defenders of the status quo in Europe.
The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don’t want to become like Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hard-won social guarantees.
Quality, costs, and delivery times in auto manufacturing, for example, are reaching the European level.
Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging world-class companies, particularly in India, are increasingly able to recruit M.I.T. and Harvard graduates, while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness.
Unfortunately, although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms.
In fact, it would be fair to say that European politicians, with few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia.
Of course, on a continent that has largely failed to bury its past and close the door to nationalist ghosts, the EU is also often regarded by Asians as a model of reconciliation, peace, and prosperity.
But if Europe’s performance continues to decline, would this perception survive?
The Hamas Earthquake
Hamas’s crushing defeat of Fatah in this week’s elections brings the Palestinian people to a crossroads.
An Islamist political party that previously abstained from national politics and rejects Fatah’s policy of negotiations with Israel, is now in charge in Palestine.
Overall, that’s 60% of the seats in Parliament, won in nearly every district in the West Bank and Gaza.
For their part, Fatah officials seem unwilling to join a Hamas-led government.
Although Hamas has said that it would seek such a coalition, Fatah’s humiliating defeat has left it with little credibility as a governing partner.
So far, Fatah’s senior leaders have declared that they will be a loyal opposition in Parliament, leaving governmental responsibility to Hamas.
Instead, they will have to focus on rebuilding and reenergizing Fatah.
It is unlikely that Hamas will form a government composed of hardliners.
The political, security, and economic circumstances of the Palestinians require a government focused on solving problems, not ideological purity.
The most urgent challenge facing the new government is rampant lawlessness and anarchy throughout Palestinian society.
Murder, kidnapping, and extortion have reached record heights.
In opposition, Hamas adamantly refused to collect illegal weapons.
Now, it will have to deal with a Palestinian society that is armed to the teeth, with poverty rates reaching 70% and unemployment at 35% .
Senior Hamas officials are well aware of the challenge, and have promised a complete overhaul of Palestinian public services and administration.
More than anything else, Hamas’s success in the coming months will be measured by its response to these issues.
Will Hamas be able to root out corruption and incompetence, and deliver services fairly and efficiently?
How will its election affect Palestine’s foreign aid inflows, which form major component of the national budget?
Initial international reaction to the Hamas victory has been severe.
The Bush administration has declared that it will not deal with a Hamas government, because Hamas remains committed to Israel’s destruction.
Interestingly, however, Hamas’s election platform combined different approaches to the issue of a Palestinian state.
On the one hand, Hamas agreed for the first time to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now.
But it is clear that Hamas is now vulnerable to public opinion and, as a governing authority, will have to deal with the international response to its victory.
Immediately after the election, a senior Hamas official, Mahmoud al-Zahar, said that Hamas would maintain the cease-fire with Israel begun last February, if Israel did the same.
Hamas may be signaling that it will not provoke Israel.
In any case, despite the election results, and even without Fatah in government, Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel.
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks, although Israel, like the US, has refused to deal with Hamas.
They elected a party which called for “reform and change” in response to a decade of violence and lawlessness.
And Palestinians accepted Hamas’s view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions.
Victory achieved, Hamas will take on the responsibility for the Palestinian side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
With the Palestinians’ future at stake – not to mention the future of Israel and the Middle East – no one can say if Hamas is up to the task.
The Hour of Hamas
How the Palestinians respond depends largely on how the Palestinian body politic deals with the growing power of Palestinian Islamic movements, which undoubtedly expect a significant share of power in post-withdrawal Gaza.
Will armed groups resume their fight against Israel, or will the Palestinian Authority act to defuse or combat the attacks?
Abbas also wants weapons in only one set of hands – those of the Palestinian Authority.
He successfully persuaded Palestinian militants to hold their fire and show Israelis and the world that dismantling settlements need not involve Israeli-Palestinian violence.
But can he translate this achievement into an extended ceasefire, peaceful elections, and consolidated PA rule in Gaza and the northern West Bank?
Failure to do so will lead to yet another defeat for the legitimate Palestinian aim of attaining a viable state.
Hamas has launched an intensive media campaign to appropriate the Israeli withdrawal as a victory of its “armed struggle.”
The campaign and its themes reflect an internal fight for control of the Gaza Strip and other PA-administered territories, and stresses Hamas’ determination not to be disarmed and to continue the “armed struggle” in the West Bank.
The second is the “Qassamits,” young women who are engaged in combat training.
Hamas timed these revelations with the disengagement to create the impression that its intensifying military strategy had prevailed.
According to one Hamas slogan in the streets of Gaza during the Israeli withdrawal, “Four years of sacrifices weigh more than ten years of negotiations.”
Similarly, Mohamed Deif, the leader of Hamas’s military wing, asserted on a recent videotape that the lesson of Gaza is that Israel can be forced out of the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Haifa.
All of this is designed to reinforce one point: the Gaza withdrawal belongs to Hamas.
A survey published on a Web site associated with Hamas claimed credit for killing 54% of all the Israelis who died as a result of Palestinians’ armed struggle, and this body count is Hamas’s claim to success.
These are not problems that can await resolution.
Someone must decide soon, for example, about the division of the land and the apartments to be built in what is already known as “Khalifa bin Zaid City,” located on a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip.
Whereas Hamas has demanded establishment of a Palestinian administration to supervise the areas vacated by Israel, Abbas has rejected this, agreeing at most to a “monitoring committee” in which representatives of Hamas will participate.
In any case, there will be no “division of areas” until Israel withdraws completely and the ruins are cleared away.
Construction of the separation wall on the West Bank has made it almost impossible for Hamas fighters to reach Israel proper.
In addition, after the reoccupation of the West Bank’s cities in April 2002, Israel arrested about 7000 Palestinians who are allegedly associated with Hamas, Fatah, and other Palestinian groups.
Hamas knows this, and thus is focusing its attention on the Gaza disengagement, seeking to exploit this victory by demanding a share in the post-disengagement order.
It has agreed to participate, for the first time, in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is due in January 2006, and it is expected to win a large number of seats.
The Limits of Democracy
The election of the militant and hitherto extra-parliamentary group Hamas in the Palestinian territories reminds us of what democracy cannot achieve.
No one in a more established democratic state is surprised if one’s own side does not win.
One remembers Hitler, who, while his own party did not quite get 50% of the vote, could base his “seizure of power” on a parliamentary majority.
More recently, elections in the post-communist countries of Europe have brought groups to power whose democratic credentials are dubious, to say the least.
This is not to compare Hamas to any of these political forces.
Nevertheless, one must wonder about a winning movement with quite a few elected members in Israeli prisons and others who are not likely to get permission to enter the country in which they were elected, so that the new parliament cannot function properly.
All of this tells us three things about democracy.
In particular, they do not create a liberal order.
To be effective, elections must be preceded by an extensive period of debate and argument.
First elections, in particular, are almost inevitably of limited value as foundations of democracy, because they take place in an emotionally charged atmosphere and largely without substantive debate.
They are an invitation to assert who one is and where one belongs rather than to a competition of well-defined and comprehensive political programs.
This means, secondly, that first elections, and perhaps elections more generally, are not themselves a sufficient guarantee of liberty.
As the German constitutional court judge Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde famously put it, democracies cannot create the conditions of their survival and success.
The answer to the first question is, the rule of law.
There must be certain accepted rules of the political game that are binding on all, so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified.
This is what happened in Iraq, for example.
But the constitutional convention, too, must be elected, and this election may run into the very difficulties that plague first elections to parliaments in new democracies.
In sovereign states and territories, this is highly unlikely to come about on its own.
It is no accident that the democratic process has emerged most smoothly where there was some external power to back up the constitution.
Some say that it is achieved only once a country has passed the “two-turnover test,” that is, two changes of government without violence.
One must add to this criterion a culture of debate that makes elections a genuine contest of a plurality of answers to the issues at stake.
For the Palestinian territories, this means that people’s expectations of the elections were probably too high.
By the same token, reducing expectations means that the significance of the results should not be exaggerated.
The Media War on Terror
“More than half of this battle is taking place on the battlefield of the media, [for] we are in a media battle in a race for the hearts and minds of [Muslims].”
The speaker was not some public relations executive, but Osama bin Laden’s chief lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Terrorists have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in today’s media age, but, for the most part, America and the governments of the other democracies have not.
Consider that the violent extremists have their own “media relations committees” aimed at manipulating elite opinion.
They know that communications transcend borders, and that a single news story, handled skillfully, can be as damaging to our cause – and as helpful to theirs – as any military attack.
And they are able to act quickly with relatively few people, and with modest resources compared to the vast, expensive bureaucracies of democratic governments.
Today we are fighting the first war in the era of e-mail, blogs, blackberries, instant messaging, digital cameras, the Internet, mobile phones, talk radio, and 24-hour news.
In Tunisia, the largest newspaper has a circulation of roughly 50,000 in a country of 10 million people.
A few years ago, under Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi could have his tongue cut out if he was found in possession of a satellite dish or used the Internet without government approval.
Today, satellite dishes are ubiquitous in Iraq as well.
Media outlets in many parts of the world often serve only to inflame and distort – rather than to explain and inform.
While al-Qaeda and extremist movements have used this forum for many years, further poisoning the Muslim public’s view of the West, we in the West have barely even begun to compete.
First published in a weekly news magazine, the story was then posted on Web sites, sent in e-mails, and repeated on satellite television and radio stations for days before the facts could be discovered.
That false story incited deadly anti-American riots in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The United States military, appropriately and of necessity, took the time needed to ensure that it had the facts before responding that the charges were untrue.
In the meantime, innocent lives were lost.
The resulting explosion of critical press stories then causes everything – all activity, all initiative – to stop.
This leads to a “chilling effect” among those serving in the military public affairs field, who conclude that there is no tolerance for innovation.
Consider for a moment the vast quantity of column inches and hours of television devoted to the allegations of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib.
Compare that to the volume of coverage and condemnation associated with, say, the discovery of Saddam Hussein’s mass graves, which were filled with hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis.
Free governments must make communications planning a central component of every aspect of this struggle.
Indeed, the longer it takes to put a strategic communications framework into place, the more the vacuum will be filled by the enemy.
They worked to help focus media attention on America’s commitment to help the Pakistani people.
Public opinion surveys conducted by private groups before and after the earthquake suggest that attitudes in Pakistan regarding the US changed dramatically because of this new awareness.
Government public affairs and public diplomacy efforts are slowly beginning to reorient staffing, schedules, and bureaucratic culture to engage the full range of today’s media.
That requires instituting 24-hour press operations centers and elevating Internet operations and other channels to the status of traditional twentieth-century press relations.
It will require less reliance on the traditional print media, just as the publics of the US and the world are relying less on newspapers.
During the Cold War, institutions such as Radio Free Europe proved to be valuable instruments.
It is a test of wills and it will be won or lost in the court of global public opinion.
While the enemy is skillful at manipulating the media and using the tools of communications to their advantage, we have an advantage as well: truth is on our side, and, ultimately, truth wins out.
The Nation State Revisited
Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.
They must join with others, as in the European Union or ASEAN or Mercosur, and they must increasingly rely on global institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.
Indeed, on closer inspection, it proves to be dubious, when not simply wrong.
The nation state, with both its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well.
The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful, and entirely absent in the case of the UN and other world institutions.
Moreover, despite the frequent search for new identities, European or Latin American or otherwise, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a “world civil society,” most people feel at home in their own country – the nation state of which they are citizens.
What does it take to be British or German or American?
Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations.
The nation state has been, and continues to be, the relevant unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings for more than two centuries.
It is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed.
The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or inward-looking.
Either way, it vitiates all attempts to create an international community of open societies.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have.
France, Spain, and Poland have attempted to keep major industries firmly in “national hands.”
Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to fragmented markets is taking root.
Although freedom of movement for labor is one of the single market’s “four freedoms,” many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible.
Germany, in particular, argues that the high unemployment resulting from reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labor market to the new member states to its east.
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically, protectionism has often led to economic conflict, which can rapidly turn into more serious clashes.
Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel – clearly a pro-European – went to the meeting with the explicit intention of barring the creation of other European powers in this field.
The German-Russian agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder leading the effort, has already harmed Polish-German relations, to say nothing of European cooperation.
This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate – indeed, dangerous – if the pendulum now swung back to old-fashioned nationalism.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
We must be vigilant in resisting the start of a trend reminiscent of developments in the early years of the twentieth century ­­– a trend that quickly led to global disaster.
The Politics of Frustration
Does extreme poverty breed violence and ultimately revolution?
Many people believe that it does, and seek to explain phenomena ranging from guerrilla insurgencies to Islamist terrorism accordingly.
But Karl Marx and Alexis de Tocqueville, the two great social analysts of the nineteenth century, knew better what makes people tick, and what makes societies change.
Extreme poverty breeds apathy, not rebellion.
A far more critical group in any society are those who have begun to move forward to new conditions, but then find their path blocked.
Their desires and ambitions are not unrealistic in the circumstances, but they are frustrated.
This group, not the desperately poor and helpless, forms the great mobilizing force of violent protest, and ultimately of major change.
The politics of frustration has been particularly apparent in the postcommunist world during the last fifteen years.
The heavy hand of nomenklatura rule was gone, and the vision of a new life like that in the open societies of the West seemed real.
Those who had the chance migrated, first to their homeland’s centers of economic progress, then abroad, to countries and places where the new world could be found immediately.
Those who stayed behind began to vote in strange ways – electing, for example, the successors of the old Communist parties that they had been glad to get rid of only a few years before.
It made the valley of tears bearable both by offering financial and other assistance and by holding out the promise of membership and economic prosperity in the near future.
Equally important, had the EU not supported the creation of an administrative and social infrastructure of liberty, there might well have been a more serious communist or even fascist backlash in Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere.
With the onset of modernization, millions of people were uprooted from their traditional communities and ways of life.
Young men, in particular, saw the prospect of a life more like that presented to them by Western television.
But they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated.
In fact, it would take at least a generation, during which much of the effort of modern life would have to be made, while the fruits of this effort would remain elusive.
Earlier generations may have borne the burden of working and waiting more readily, but nowadays people want results here and now.
If the benefits do not come quickly – and for most people they do not – they get restless.
Those who do not manage to get to other countries, or who fail in the countries to which they have migrated, are in a quandary.
For them, the old world of traditional ties and customs is gone, but the new world of modernity remains out of reach.
Seductive leaders (Hitler among them) exploited the resulting sense of frustration.
Whatever the value of such theories, it is evident that the frustration of young people’s ambitions in modernizing countries makes them the object of preachers of hate and tempts them to leave the course of plodding progress and turn to more dramatic action.
What we call “terrorism” has many causes, and one must beware of facile explanations.
However, the politics of frustration, of ambitions raised and then thwarted, is clearly one such cause.
It is thus also a challenge to those of us living in more fortunate circumstances.
If we do not wish to be submerged in violence and authoritarian responses to it, international institutions must do for the modernizing world what the EU has managed to do for the postcommunist countries.
The Promise of Iraq’s Constitution
The constitutional process now under way in Iraq represents a hopeful milestone for all Iraqis.
After decades of successively imposed constitutions, an elected assembly has overseen the process of drafting a new permanent constitution, and the draft text will be voted on by ordinary Iraqis on October 15.
Much of the current talk about the draft’s various provisions thus misses the point.
Regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails, and regardless of the details of the constitutional text, what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq, before and after the referendum.
Concerning the pre-referendum phase, the National Assembly largely succeeded in this task.
Although Iraq’s interim constitution gave the Assembly exclusive control over the drafting process, the Assembly wisely reached out beyond its membership in creating a constitutional drafting committee.
Iraqi leaders were well aware of the decreased participation in the election by a significant portion of Iraq’s multi-ethnic and multi-confessional mosaic, particularly the Sunni community.
Accordingly, they sought out those who were under-represented in the Assembly, but whose sense of participation in and ownership of the process was essential, not merely to the constitutional exercise, but to binding the nation’s wounds.
Reaching out was an important component of establishing the rule of law, and it also sent a message that Iraq had truly turned a corner – that no single party sought to dominate Iraq.
This was an important signal that those elected to the National Assembly understood that democracy does not mean merely the will of the majority.
In the end, Iraq’s voters will decide whether this is a constitution under which they wish to be governed for the foreseeable future.
Those who chose not to participate in last January’s elections will most certainly do so now, both in the referendum and in the upcoming elections to a new Assembly in December.
A second important feature of the drafting process was the extent to which the National Assembly complied with the requirements of Iraq’s interim constitution, the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL).
At the time of the transfer of authority in June of 2004, many pundits predicted that an elected National Assembly would ignore an interim constitution drafted by an unelected Governing Council and promulgated by an occupying authority.
The TAL set a rigorous schedule for the Assembly to complete an initial constitutional draft, and the Assembly essentially abided by those limits. The deadline extension that it passed was in keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the TAL.
The test for institution building, however, will come once a constitution has been approved and a new government installed.
Regardless of who wins the elections, there will be temptations to tinker with the constitutional text.
However, given the little weight given to constitutions in Iraq’s modern history, it is likely that the political class will leave the text alone.
Barring some compelling need, the calculus might well arise that it is more important to abide by the constitution for some time – and to be seen to be abiding by it – than it is even to improve its provisions.
The American administration was absolutely right to resist the call to turn Iraq over to a caudillo, as some wanted.
Iraq’s salvation from the nightmare that it endured over the previous 35 years lies not in any one man; indeed, reliance on “one man” was the central ingredient in Saddamist rule.
Here again, Iraq’s immediate past history allows one to be optimistic.
The Iraqi Governing Council was not dominated by any single member, and Iraq’s subsequent governments have also operated collegially.
Giving life to constitutionally defined political institutions is far more important to the course of Iraq’s immediate future than the specific provisions that the constitution contains.
That has been the missing ingredient, not only in Iraq, but also in other countries ruled by despots.
Constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals, and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights.
The question is whether those guarantees are given meaning on the ground.
The Sleeping Volcano of Global Finance
The rejection of the European Union’s Constitutional Treaty by French and Dutch voters was, according to all evidence, more a rejection of unregulated globalization than it was a rejection of Europe.
The general instability of social relations – most importantly, but not only, of employment – is slowly becoming intolerable for a growing part of the population in many developed countries, not just in Europe.
Capitalism could be reconstructed after World War II because it was buttressed by three necessary types of regulation: social security, which served as a principal stabilizer, at least in the developed countries; Keynesian tools to fight domestic cyclical downturns; and a universal high-wage policy aimed at stimulating general consumption, without which the genius of capitalism – mass production – does not work.
But the realignment of the rich, developed countries around the monetarist policies promoted by economists like Milton Friedman, which began around 1970, broke with all that.
Not long after, the dollar was detached from the gold standard.
Employment is increasingly precariousness.
And where unemployment is preferred to universal job insecurity, it has become impossible to suppress.
It is to this state of affairs that the French and Dutch said “no” two months ago.
After all, beyond the social misery produced by the re-institutionalized cruelty of the current global economic system, the greatest danger facing the world nowadays is that very system’s inherent instability.
I don’t see any institution other than the EU that has enough size and heft to protect Europeans from a possible implosion.
Consider the simple fact that the American economy is now more than $600 billion in debt.
The United States cannot function without being able to borrow $1.9 billion dollars each and every day of the year, mainly from the emerging economies of Asia, and China above all.
But this support could weaken or even cease if the dollar falls too low, if the price of oil rises too high, or if the American economy backfires.
In fact, the US economy has become increasingly detached from reality.
Meanwhile, two speculative bubbles – in the real estate market and in mortgages – have become grafted upon each other and now dominate economic activity in the US.
A crash, or at least a sharp spasm, is quite likely in the near future, and the consequences – for America and the world – may be catastrophic.
This instability also makes it difficult to address other grave problems affecting the global financial system.
Sovereign debt, needed by all countries, but particularly by the poorest, suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements.
To make matters worse, national failures can no longer be addressed without aggravating the situation.
Of course – indeed, above all – in such circumstances the immense investments needed to overcome underdevelopment and the disabilities that it entails are increasingly forgotten by the world of international finance.
With rich countries threatened by instability and poor countries largely left to their own devices, the reconstruction of the world financial system should be at the top of the international agenda.
A new Bretton Woods could not be more urgent!
The Trade-and-Aid Myth
More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries’ markets for poor countries’ products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda.
Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but howmuch to do, and how fast.
Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts.
Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world’s most powerful economy.
Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains.
This one faces a trade embargo in the world’s largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank.
If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade (in the form of state trading, import tariffs, and quantitative restrictions).
As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.
Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis).
By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that.
Vietnam still remains outside the WTO.
Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico’s economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms.
This is not only far below the rates of Asia’s economic superstars; it is also a fraction of Mexico’s own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then.
Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell.
What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country’s economic fortunes.
All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso’s exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy.
With none of Mexico’s advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers.
Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most.
South Korea took off in the early 1960’s not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out.
It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes – Botswana and Mauritius – to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.
Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets.
The word “diamond” hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius.
They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators – for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign.
Similarly, increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries, and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US, would produce greater long-term development impact.
It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North.
Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries.
Today’s Counter-Enlightenment
A process that had begun with the Enlightenment had now reached the point at which “anything goes.”
Particularly in the arts, there were no apparent limits to showing what even a generation ago would have been regarded as highly offensive.
Two generations ago, most countries had censors who not only tried to prevent younger people from seeing certain films but who actually banned books.
Since the 1960’s, such proscriptions have weakened until, in the end, explicit sexuality, violence, blasphemy – while upsetting to some people – were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world.
The denial of a well-documented truth may lead to new crimes.
But is the answer to the old question, “What is truth?” always so clear?
What exactly are we doing if we insist on Turkey’s acknowledgement that the Armenian genocide did take place as a condition of its membership in the European Union?
Are we so sure of Darwin’s theories of evolution that we should ban alternative notions of genesis from schools?
One such limit is the incitement to violence.
The man who gets up in a crowded theater and shouts, “Fire!” when there is none is guilty of what happens in the resulting stampede.
This is the context in which we may see the invasion of Islamic taboos into the enlightened, mostly non-Islamic world.
From the fatwa on Salman Rushdie for The Satanic Verses to the killing of a nun in Somalia in response to Pope Benedict’s Regensburg lecture and the Berlin Opera’s cancellation of a performance of Mozart’s Idomeneo , with its severed heads of religious founders, including Muhammad, we have seen violence and intimidation used to defend a particular religion’s taboos.
There are questions here that are not easily answered by civilized defenders of the Enlightenment.
Toleration and respect for people who have their own beliefs are right and perhaps necessary to preserve an enlightened world.
This means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not.
If anyone does not like them, there are all the instruments of public debate and of critical discourse that an enlightened community has at its disposal.
The kind of reaction we have seen recently to expressions of views that are offensive to some does not bode well for the future of liberty.
It is as if a new wave of counter-enlightenment is sweeping the world, with the most restrictive views dominating the scene.
Whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad (or Christ, for that matter) is a matter of judgment, almost of taste.
I might not do it, but I would nevertheless defend the right of someone who decides otherwise.
Universities: Renaissance or Decay?
“Europe’s universities, taken as a group, are failing to provide the intellectual and creative energy that is required to improve the continent’s poor economic performance.”
This dramatic statement introduces a new pamphlet whose subtitle, “Renaissance or Decay,” I have borrowed for this reflection.
The pamphlet’s two authors, Richard Lambert, a former editor of the Financial Times and future Director General of the Confederation of British Industry, and Nick Butler, the Group Vice President for Strategy and Policy Development at British Petroleum do not represent vested academic interests.
What they say about Europe probably applies to most other parts of the world as well, though not to the United States.
Lambert and Butler identify four main weaknesses of European universities that must be addressed.
They call for:
greater diversity in place of today’s conformity; incentives for universities to succeed, which implies the need to set their ambitions higher; less bureaucracy and more freedom and accountability; above all, more adequate funding to bring European universities close to the US level of 2.6% of GDP, from less than half on average. Not everyone will consider the underlying assumption of this analysis compelling.
Yet it is by no means certain that education systems in which 50% or more of each generation strive to attain a university degree are best suited to cope with the exigencies of the twenty-first century.
Many jobs are, in fact, not “high tech,” but, in the words of Britain’s Adair Turner, “high touch” – service-sector jobs that do not require a university education.
Were we to settle for, say, 25% of each generation on the academic track, universities in Europe, and indeed in many other parts of the world, would still have to overcome their unfortunate tendency to define their purposes against the business world.
This tendency has been detrimental both for the business world, which is deprived of the cultural wealth provided by higher education, and for universities, because it removes them from their proper setting in the real world.
They engage with students rather than eagerly awaiting breaks and holidays to pursue their own projects.
They are true university teachers rather than people who invoke the “unity of teaching and research” in order to concentrate on research subjects and hope that teaching will take care of itself.
Moreover, the research atmosphere of American universities is characterized by a great deal of informal cooperation.
People meet in laboratories and seminars, but also in common rooms and cafeterias.
This is also what they miss even as they relapse into the bad old habits at home.
As in so many other respects, universities not only in Europe, but also in Japan, South Korea, and developing parts of the world, including China and India, need to loosen rigid structures and habits to avoid decay and nurture a renaissance.
Why Pay More for Fairness?
Marks & Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of “ethical production.”
The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops.
The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages.
In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers.
Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage.
For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall.
Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.
Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers’ associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor.
Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a “well-meaning dead end.”
With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.
In Lindsey’s view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops – and here he rightly points to rich nations’ trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled – or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices.
If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that’s what James Bond prefers, economists don’t object that the market is being distorted.
So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.
If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.
From the growers’ perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.
Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly.
One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending.
